      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.16.x</h1>

      <p><em>Note:</em> No release has been made yet in this
      series. This document documents the progress of development, and
      the state of snapshots sometimes found on the download page, in
      a form which will hopefuly be found easier to read than the
      Mercurial changelog on BitBucket.</p>

      <h2>Caveats</h2>


      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.16 is
        mostly compatible with 1.15 indexes (except for a few
        differences for really weird terms). Perform a full index pass
        if installing over an older version. The simplest way to do
        this is to quit all recoll programs and just delete the index
        directory
        (<span class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>).  <span class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span>
        will do the same in most cases.</p>


      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.16 current change list:</p> 

      <ul>

        <li>We can now perform negative directory filtering (-dir:/some/dir),
          to return all results except those from the
          specified directory (recursive). Other attempts at still
          impossible negative searches
          (ie: <span class="literal">-mime:</span>) now cause explicit
          errors messages instead of lame results. The inverted
          directory filtering is accessible from the query language
          and by checking a checkbox in the advanced search
          panel.</li>

        <li>It is now possible to set an increased weight for indexing
          some fields. The title fields gets a boost by default. See
          the <tt>fields</tt> default file for details.</li>

        <li>The query language allows setting weights on terms, ie,
          as in: <tt>"important"2.5</tt> .</li>

        <li>The GUI advanced search panel allows specifying a
          field for each entry (ie: author/recipient, etc).</li>

        <li>It is possible to configure the result list snippet
           separator, given as an html fragment. This is an ellipsis by
          default (&amp;hellip;). </li>

        <li>The preview window popup menu has a "save to file" entry
          to write a subdocument (ie: mail attachement) to a file.</li>

        <li>Images are displayed in preview. You can get at the fields
          and complete extracted text using the popup menu.</li>

        <li>Improved preservation of indentation for text files
          displayed in the preview window.</li>

        <li>Show hidden (dot) files in the indexing configuration
          GUI dialogs.</li>

        <li>Added filters for .war (Konqueror web archive) and .mhtm (other web
          archive format).</li>

        <li>Improved handling for native cjk punctuation signs.</li>

        <li>Updated the list of native apps in the
          default <tt>mimeview</tt> (ie: xv->gwenview, rox->dolphin,
          etc.)</li>

        <li>Added -f option to recollindex to ignore
          skippedPaths/Names when used with -i. Allows the use of a
          purely external file selection mechanism.</li>

        <li>Result table:
          <ul>
            <li>The detail area now has a popup menu similar
              to the one in the result list (open parent, save to disk
              etc.).</li>
            <li>Estimated result counts are displayed in the status line.</li>
            <li>Set row height according to default font size, and better 
              adjust row height and vertical text position in
              cells.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Real time indexer: several configuration
          parameters allow adjusting the timing of indexing actions:
          <ul>
            <li><tt>monauxinterval</tt>: the interval between auxiliary
              databases rebuilds (stemdb, aspell).</li>
            <li><tt>monixinterval</tt>: The waiting period
              during which indexing events are accumulated prior to actual
              indexing (saves work on duplicate events).</li>
            <li><tt>mondelaypatterns</tt>: a list of file patterns for
              which indexing should be delayed longer (quick changing
              files like logs that should be reindexed much slower than
              they change).</li>
          </ul>
          See the default configuration file for more detail.
        </li>

        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
            <li>UTF-8 paths inside ZIP archives were mishandled. Also
              fixes problem with colons inside archive member
              paths.</li>
            <li>Fixed GUI result list doc parent operations (open/preview)
              which were broken in 1.15.</li>
            <li>Fixed case where indexing could hang or crash after an
              error occured while indexing an archive member (which
              should have affected only the relevant document).</li>
            <li>Real time indexer: uncontrolled concurrent access to
              the global configuration could cause a startup crash (mostly of
              big file trees because of timing issues).</li>
            <li>Fixed sorting by document and file size in the result
              table.</li> 
            <li>Email messages for which there would be an error indexing
              an attachment would not be indexed at all.</li>
            <li>Text files bigger than 2 GB could not be indexed.</li>
            <li>Fixed the handling of compressed man pages.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
