      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.22.x</h1>
      
      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.19 </p>

      <p>1.20-22 indexes are fully compatible. Installing 1.22
        over an 1.19 index is possible, but there have been small
        changes in the way compound words (e.g. email addresses) are
        indexed, so it will be best to reset the index. Still, in a
        pinch, 1.22 search can mostly use an 1.19 index. </p>

      <p>Always reset the index if you do not know by which version it
        was created (you're not sure it's at least 1.18). The best method
        is to quit all Recoll programs and delete the index directory 
        (<span class="literal">
          rm -rf ~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then start <code>recoll</code>
        or <code>recollindex</code>. <br> 

        <span class="literal">recollindex -z</span> will do the same
        in most, but not all, cases. It's better to use
        the <tt>rm</tt> method, which will also ensure that no debris
        from older releases remain (e.g.: old stemming files which are
        not used any more).</p>

      <p>Case/diacritics sensitivity is off by default. It can be
        turned on <em>only</em> by editing
        recoll.conf (
        <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
          see the manual</a>). If you do so, you must then reset the
        index.</p>
