      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.22.x</h1>
      
      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.19 </p>

      <p>1.20-22 indexes are fully compatible. Installing 1.22
        over an 1.19 index is possible, but there have been small
        changes in the way compound words (e.g. email addresses) are
        indexed, so it will be best to reset the index. Still, in a
        pinch, 1.22 search can mostly use an 1.19 index. </p>

      <p>Always reset the index if you do not know by which version it
        was created (e.g.: you're not sure it's at least 1.18). The
        best method is to quit all Recoll programs and delete the
        index directory (<span class="literal">
          rm -rf ~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then start <code>recoll</code>
        or <code>recollindex</code>. <br> 

        <span class="literal">recollindex -z</span> will do the same
        in most, but not all, cases. It's better to use
        the <tt>rm</tt> method, which will also ensure that no debris
        from older releases remain (e.g.: old stemming files which are
        not used any more).</p>

      <p>Case/diacritics sensitivity is off by default. It can be
        turned on <em>only</em> by editing
        recoll.conf (
        <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
          see the manual</a>). If you do so, you must then reset the
        index.</p> 

      <h2>Changes in Recoll 1.22.0</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>The main "feature" in recoll 1.22 is that it has
          a <a href="pages/recoll-windows.html">Microsoft Windows
            version</a>. This is has been tested on Windows 7 and 
          Windows 10, and it works mostly like the Unix version, with
          the notable exceptions that it has no real-time mode (need to
          start indexing by hand from the GUI, or arrange something with
          the command-line recollindex.exe). Also there are a few very
          Unix-y file types which are not processed on Windows, and the
          indexer is single-threaded.</li>

        <li>It is now possible to define synonyms groups, used only at
          query-time to expand the query terms to their defined
          synonyms.
          <a href="http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/webhelp/docs/RCL.SEARCH.SYNONYMS.html">
            More details</a>.</li>
        
        <li>Many shell-script input handlers have been converted to
          Python and are now persistent. Most are compatible with
          Python3 (the only ones which are not are kept back by the
          library they use). There are still a few shell handlers,
          mostly for less used and Linux-only formats. And a single
          Perl-based one (rclimg, which uses the excellent exiftool
          Perl library).</li>

        <li>The Unix/Linux build system has been converted to use the
          autotools in a fairly standard way. The Windows build is
          based on Qt Creator and MinGW.</li>

        <li>Make dehyphenation (co-worker->coworker in addition to the
          normal terms) optional, active by default.</li>

        <li>For people using the Firefox web page indexer add-on: a
          new tool in the GUI to list and delete entries from the Web
          cache.</li>
      
        <li>Improved index statistics in the GUI, and improved display
          while the indexer is working.</li>
        
      </ul>

      <h2>Minor releases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1.22.1:
          <ul>
            <li>Sidestep bus error in qt exit code by calling _exit()
              instead of exit() in GUI exit code.</li>
            <li>Eliminate the dependance of librecoll.so on libX11.</li>
            <li>Hungarian translation.</li>
            <li>GUI: enable displaying the Xapian docid in the result
              list with %x.</li>
            <li>GUI, advanced search: fix crash which occurred when
              restoring clause list bigger than the default size (6
              clauses).</li>
            <li>The documentation (user manual and man page) for
              recoll.conf is now generated from the structured
              comments in the sample file.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
