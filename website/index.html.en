      <p class="remark">Recoll will index an <b>MS-Word</b> document
      stored as an <b>attachment</b> to an <b>e-mail message</b> inside
	  a <b>Thunderbird folder</b> archived in a <b>Zip file</b>
	  (and more...). It will also help you search for it with a
	  friendly and powerful interface, and let you open a copy of
	  the file with a single mouse click. There is little that
	  will remain hidden on your disk.

              Web browser interface</a> for querying your Recoll
              indexes.</dd>  

        <dt>2013-04-14</dt><dd>Release 1.18.2 fixes a few really minor
          <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_18_1">bugs in 1.18.1</a>. I
          will not package it.</dd>

        <dt>2012-12-14</dt><dd>The next version of Recoll indexing will be
          multithreaded, and much faster on most current
          processors. The conversion has been an interesting project
          with multiple stages, and I've taken 
          <a href="idxthreads/threadingRecoll.html">a few  notes</a> 
          about the transformation.</dd>
        </dd>

        <dt>2012-11-05</dt><dd>Recoll 1.18.1 is out. It has optional
          character case and diacritics sensitivity, direct access to
          the hit page when opening PDF files, complex search history,
          and a host of other smaller improvements. See
          the <a href="release-1.18.html">release
            notes</a>.
          <span class="important">Those of you not using <b>evince</b>
          as a PDF/Postscript/DVI viewer may be surprised to see the
          recoll GUI try to use this viewer anyway.</span>This is because
            some of the new functions in 1.18 work better
            with <b>evince</b>, but you can override the choice by
            going to the GUI preferences, and removing
            application/pdf, application/postscript and
            application/dvi from the <tt>Exceptions</tt> list.
        </dd>

        <dt>2012-10-30</dt> <dd>Recoll has a brand new Firefox extension for
          indexing visited Web pages. This is very similar to the old
          Beagle plugin, but slightly better integrated (no-fuss
          installation), and with a new lease on life. See
          <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/recollfirefox/">
            Dave King's project page on sourceforge</a> and the
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/IndexWebHistory">
            page about Recoll (trivial) configuration</a>.</dd>

        <dt>2012-10-25</dt> <dd>A problem with a simple workaround has caused
          several reported <span class="important">recollindex
          crashes</span> recently (for 1.17). If you store and index
          Mozilla/Thunderbird email out of the standard location
          (~/.thunderbird), you should add the following at the end of
          your configuration file (e.g.:
          ~/.recoll/recoll.conf): <pre><tt>
              [/path/to/my/mozilla/mail]
              mhmboxquirks = tbird
          </tt></pre> Adjust the path to your local value of course...
          Without this hint, recollindex has trouble finding the
          message delimiters inside the folder files, and will
          possibly use all the computer's memory and crash. Apart from
          crashes, which only occur for very big folders, this also
          causes incorrect mail indexing.

        <dt>2012-03-27</dt> <dd>Recoll gets a Ubuntu Unity Lens. If
        you are running
          an Ubuntu release where this makes sense, you can install
          the recoll-lens package from the 
          <a href="https://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/recoll-1.15-on">
            Recoll PPA</a>. The Lens uses the Recoll GUI as a proxy to
          extract and display embedded documents, which native utilities
          can't reach directly. And of course you still need to run
          the GUI (or the command line recollindex) to get the indexing
          going !</dd>
