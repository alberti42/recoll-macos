      <h1>Recoll journal of user-visible changes </h1>
      <h2><a name="1.12.0">1.12.0</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Recoll now implements a KIO slave to allow searching
	  directly from KDE applications. This does not affect the
	  main application and is not enabled by default (go to the
	  kde/kio/recoll source directory for build
	  instructions). </li>
	<li>Recoll now computes md5 checksums for all indexed
	  documents and optionally collapses duplicate entries inside
	  the result list. This needs a full reindex to become
	  effective for older documents already in the index. The
	  option for collapsing or not is in the <i>Query
	  Configuration</i>.</li>
	<li>Typing F1 anywhere in the GUI should bring up the
	  appropriate section of the manual in the application
	  configured for viewing HTML documents.</li>
	<li>The result list right click menu now has an entry to
	  save the document to a file. This is only enabled for
	  documents contained inside another file (ie, messages inside
	  an mbox folder, or attachments), and is especially useful for
	  extracting an attachment with no associated external
	  editor.</li>
	<li>The preview window now has a right-click menu, with an
	  entry to toggle between viewing the main text or all the
	  metadata for the document. This is most useful in the case
	  where the search match actually occurred in a field not
	  visible in the main text (ie: author or HTML title).</li>
	<li>Words glued by an underscore character like
	  <i>compound_word</i> are now split during indexing, and
	  will be found when queried either as themselves or in a
	  search for the components.</li>
	<li>There is now a size limit over which no attempt will be made to
	  uncompress/identify/index compressed files. Not active by
	  default, to be set in the <i>Indexing Configuration</i>.</li>
	<li>Fixed possibly harmful bug in strerror_r usage (GNU case).</li>
	<li>Added support for fetching field values from extended file
	  attributes. This is not enabled by default, use 
	  <i>configure&nbsp;--enable-xattr</i>. You'll also need to
	  set up a map from the attributes names to the Recoll field
	  names (see comment at the end of the <i>fields</i>
	  configuration file.</li> 
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="1.11.4">1.11.4</a></h2>
      <ul>

	<li>Bugs fixed:
	  check the <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_11_1">list</a>.</li>  

	<li>The right-click menu "Copy" commands inside the result list
	  now copy to the clipboard in addition to the main selection,
	  enabling subsequent ^v commands.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2><a name="1.11.0">1.11.0</a></h2>

      <p><i>Recoll release 1.11 has relatively extensive changes that have
	  necessitated a modification of the index format. Hence installing this
	  release implies a full re-indexing, which is enforced by the
	  software.</i></p> 

      <ul>
	<li>Filtering on category (message/text/media etc.) as a function of
	  the main window for quick access.</li>

	<li>Use html for preview when available (ex: html files or "colorized"
	  python) instead of converting to text. This can be turned of in the
	  preferences. </li>

	<li>New Python query and index interfaces. The Python query
	  interface will be used for building a Xesam adapter for
	  Recoll when the specification is stabilized, and could be
	  useful for other things, such as indexing contents from an
	  RDBMS (see 
	  <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.PROGRAM.API">
	  the manual</a> for details). Restructured and cleaned up
	  internal Recoll interfaces.</li>

	<li>Improved filter framework. Can now process either html or text output
	  from the filters, and more easily execute "raw" commands instead of
	  Recoll scripts. Avoided wasteful repeated execution of filters for
	  which the helper application is missing.</li>

	<li>Query language now closer to Xesam specification, (but
	  still far from a 
	  complete implementation). See the Recoll manual and
	  <a href="http://www.xesam.org/main/XesamUserSearchLanguage">
	    http://www.xesam.org/main/XesamUserSearchLanguage</a> </li>
	  
	<li>Much improved configuration for fields. Fields like
	  "author" can now be specified as storable (displayable in
	  results) and/or indexed (searchable). Added alias facility
	  for translating from user-level names to internal.</li>

	<li>Added "recipient" as an indexed/searchable field for emails.</li>

	<li>rcltext filter for processing text such as C code for which no specific
	  processing is needed when indexing but a specific viewer is
	  desired.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="1.10.6">1.10.6</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Fix a simple and mildly nasty bug that would cause the
	  indexer to stop 
	  indexing an mbox on encountering a specific but not exceptional error
	  condition (like a few dozen errors while indexing attachments for which
	  no filter was installed).</li>
      </ul>


      <h2><a name="1.10.5">1.10.5</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Ensure that file names indexed as terms don't overflow the maximum term
	  size.</li>

	<li> Handle non-standard date format in mbox separator lines sometimes
	  generated by thunderbird.

	<li> Use attachment file names to help identify a better mime type for
	  parts only described as application/octet-stream

	<li> For Phrase/Near searches, highlight all term groups in preview, not just
	  the first

	<li> Added Open XML filters

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.10.2">1.10.2</a></h2>
      <ul>

	<li>Fixed openSuse 11 compile issues.

	<li>Fixed bug in interpreting email mime structure, which resulted in base-64
	  decoding errors.

	<li>Fixed "Prev" button in preview window. Would actually go forward when
	  walking the search terms.

	<li> Allow setting the highlight color for search terms in result list and
	  preview (yes: feature change, should have waited for major release...)

	<li> Added svg filter

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.10.1">1.10.1</a></h2>
      <ul>

	<li> Ensure that in case the data of a file can't be indexed because of some
	  error, at least the file name is indexed.

	<li> Improve query language to support OR queries of terms with field
	  specifications (ie: title:someterm OR author:someauthor).

	<li> Fix filename search to split patterns on white space, so that 
	  a "*.jpg *.jpeg" search does what's expected. Means you now need to use
	  double-quotes if there is actual embedded white space.

	<li> Jump directly to the external editor choice dialog instead of opening
	  preferences when an external viewer is not found.

	<li> Allow stopping indexing through menu action (only works with qt4 for now).

	<li> Create an "indexedmimetypes" configuration variable to allow explicitely
	  restricting the file types which do get indexed.


      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.10.0">1.10.0</a></h2>
      <ul>

	<li> Added a GUI dialog to configure the indexing parameters.

	<li> Added better support for indexing CJK text (Chinese, Japanese, Korean). 
	  Please note that:
	  - You will need a full reindex to take good advantage of this. (You
	  *don't* need to reindex if you don't need to search CJK, even if there
	  is some in your index).
	  - When entering CJK search terms, words (single or multiple characters)
	  should be separated with white space.
	  - The specific CJK processing can be turned off by setting the nocjk
	  variable to true in the configuration file (this may make sense if you
	  have a mixed cjk/other document base and don't want to index the cjk
	  part, as it will save some disk space and a minuscule amount of cpu).

	<li> Changed the way Recoll handles searches including composite words (like
	  an email address). The new approach looks saner, but could have
	  side-effects, please report any problems in this area.

	<li> The query language got a new "dir:" specifier to filter results on location.

	<li> New rclimg perl filter for better indexing of picture tags, thanks to
	  Cedric Scott. This depends on Exiftool.
	<li> New rcltex filter.

	<li> Changed and improved how the preview window local search finds the
	  query terms, this does not involve weird characters any more. The
	  display is cleaner and cut and paste works better.

	<li> Fixed the fact that a newline-separated word list in simple search would
	  wrongly trigger a phrase search.

	<li> Fixed the way we input text to the preview textedit (the old way would
	  sometimes confuse the window into displaying tags instead of acting on
	  them).

	<li> Fixed transcoding to utf-8 for text/plain email attachments

	<li> Improved mbox From_ line detection

	<li> Added indexedmimetypes variables to allow restricting the list of indexed
	  mime types.

	<li> KDE kicker applet: start a recoll search from the panel and get a
	  Recoll window. This is a clone from the find_applet, originally meant to
	  start a Tracker search. Not so useful presently because it will start a
	  new Recoll instance for every search. Not part of the main source (the
	  configure script is a whopping 1MB...), linked from the download page.
	<li> Added recoll command line options to define a query and execute it
	  immediately when the program starts. This is used in practice from the
	  applet and could be used from other programs. There is a also a new
	  option to not start the GUI and print the results to stdout.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.9.0">1.9.0</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Incompatible change: the icon image reference is now part of the result
	  list paragraph format string:
	  - If you had a standard config, you need do nothing.
	  - If you had a custom format string, you need to add
	  <img src="%I" align="left"> at its beginning to get the same result as
	  before.
	  - If you had unchecked the "show icons" option, you need to remove the
	  above string from the paragraph format to make the icons go away.
	  Changes to the format string are performed in the 
	  "Preferences->Query Configuration->User Interface" dialog tab.

	<li> New filters: wordperfect, abiword and kword, rcljpeg, rclflac, rclogg
	  (contributed filters). The jpeg and audio filters should be extended to
	  make use of the new field indexing/search capability (hint :) )

	<li> When searching for an empty string inside the preview window, position
	  the window to the next occurrence of a primary search term.

	<li> Added ext: and mime: selectors to the query language.

	<li> Added an adjustable flush threshold during indexing: should help control
	  memory usage. See the idxflushmb configuration variable.

	<li> Added a check for file system free space. Indexing will stop if the
	  threshold is reached. See the maxfsoccuppc configuration parameter.

	<li> Added 'followLinks' configuration option to have the indexer follow
	  symbolic links while walking the tree (the default is false).

	<li> Allow symbolic links as 'topdirs' members. These are always followed.

	<li> Add preference option to remember sort tool state between program
	  invocations (it is reset to inactive by default)

	<li> Added File menu entry to erase document history.

	<li> Bound the space and backspace keys to PgUp/PgDown in preview.

	<li> (Hopefully) Improved abstract (keyword in context) generation

	<li> Added support for arbitrary fields. Filters can now produce any number of
	  fields which will be selectively searchable through the query
	  language. This could be useful, for exemple, for the mp3 and jpeg filters
	  (but it is not currently used).

	<li> Improved qt4 build: no more need for --enable-qt4. Note: the qt4 build
	  still needs the qt3 support library.

	<li> Changed the icon to an ugly one. The previous one was nicer but looked
	  too much like Xapian's.

	<li> Added some kind of support for a stopword list.

	<li> Have email attachments inherit date and author from their parent message
	  (instead of mail folder).

	<li> Fix bus error on rclmon exit

	<li> Better handling of aspell errors inside rclmon

	<li> Fixed a number of qt4 glitches: selection and keyboard shortcuts.

	<li> New query configuration parameter to set the maximum text size beyond
	  which text won't be hilighted before preview (takes too much time). This
	  was a fixed value in 1.8.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.8.2">1.8.2 2007-05-19</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Fixed method name for compatibility with xapian 1.0.0
	<li> Add .beagle to default list of skipped names (avoids indexing beagle
	  document cache...)
	<li> Fix configure.ac to use $libdir instead of /usr/lib
	<li> Fix recollinstall to properly copy translations and pictures for qt4

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.8.1">1.8.1 2007-02-20</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Add a small query language with some field-based searches (author, title,
	  etc.)
	<li> Add wildcard handling everywhere. *, ?, [] can be used in any
	  search. Warning: using a wild card at the left of a term can make
	  for a very slow search.
	<li> Allow skipping specific paths during indexing (in addition to file name
	  patterns)
	<li> Improved external index choice dialog, accessible from the top-level menu.
	<li> Many small bugs fixed: stemming language choice ignored in term explorer,
	  qt4 preview window reentrancy crashes, issues with saving the default
	  advanced search file, type filter, display more clearly missing helper
	  errors, etc. 
	<li> Option to use the desktop defaults (with xdg-open) to choose the native
	  viewer for files (instead of recoll's mimeview). 

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.7.6">1.7.6 2007-01-30</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Fixes an issue with the openoffice filter on debian systems. 
	<li> Adds Scribus and Lyx filters.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.7.5">1.7.5 2007-01-15</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Fixes two email indexing bugs in 1.7.3, which would bail out from an
	  mbox folder on the first attachment filtering error, and would decline
	  to handle multipart/signed bodies. You may need to run a full indexing
	  pass (recollindex -z), to force reindexing of old folders.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.7.3">1.7.3 2007-01-09</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Email attachments are now indexed.
	<li> Right-click menu option to access the parent document of an embedded
	  result (ie from mail attachment to parent message), or the parent folder
	  of a given file (which is opened with the application configured for
	  directories) 
	<li> The sort tool has been improved: no need to restart the query after sort
	  criteria change. 
	<li> Support for real-time indexing with inotify is now enabled by default
	  when appropriate.
	<li> Recoll now warns when the configured native viewer can not be found and
	  starts an interface for chosing another one.
	<li> Categories (text, presentation, spreadsheets, etc.) can be used instead
	  of raw mime types when filtering on file types in advanced search.
	<li> The port to qt4 is functional and can be enabled with configure --enable-qt4
	<li> 'autophrase' option improved and may now actually be useful.
	<li> Improved highlighting (again...)
	<li> Display term frequencies in term explorer.
	<li> Recollindex -e to remove data from index for listed files.
	<li> Directory names now indexed. Directories can be 'edited' with the
	  configured application (rox by default)

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.6.3">1.6.3</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Fixed problem with bad detection of mbox message boundaries.
	  Upgrading can change the message numbering in some cases, and you should
	  perform a full index update (recollindex -z) after installing
	  the new version.
	<li> Fixed problem with execution of external viewer for files with
	  single-quotes in the name.
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.6.2">1.6.2</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Minor solaris compilation glitches only.
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.6.1">1.6.1</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Term explorer: a multimode wildcard-regexp-spell/phonetic tool to search
	  the index for terms. This uses aspell for the orthographic/phonetic part.
	<li> A more dynamic advanced search window. You now have a choice of the top
	  level conjunction (OR/AND) and of any number of clauses, including NEAR
	  and PHRASE clauses with an adjustable proximity parameter.
	<li> User-settable format for the result-list entries, which use an HTML
	  string with %xx printf-like replacements (accessible from the user
	  preferences).
	<li> Real time monitoring/indexing support. This is not configured by
	  default, and must be specified at build time (configure --help).
	<li> Improved phrase/group highlighting in abstracts and preview
	<li> Better sample selection for synthetic abstracts.
	<li> Improved performance of the text splitter, good for indexing and previewing.
	<li> Shift+click link to open new preview window instead of tab in existing
	  window.
	<li> The key sequence for term completion in the simple search entry was
	  changed from CTRL+TAB to "Escape Space" to avoid interaction with window
	  managers.
	<li> Improved recall for phrases with composite words like email addresses.


	  Updating from 1.2 to 1.3 or 1.4 or 1.5: 
	<li>--------------------------------------
	  From version 1.3 up, there is a new feature to search specifically for file
	  names (with wildcard processing). If you want to take full advantage of
	  this, you should perform a full reindex after installing the new version
	  (ie: use recollindex -z, or delete ~/.recoll/xapiandb).
	  Also, we now use the central copies of configuration files for default
	  values, and the user ones only for overrides. Your old configuration files
	  will still work, but, you may want to remove them if they are unmodified,
	  or keep only the modified parameters.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.5.9 ">1.5.9 </a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Fix bad timezone conversion in email dates. Display timezone in result
	  list dates.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.5.8">1.5.8</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Fix stored and displayed dates which used to come from the file's ctime,
	  now use mtime (which was already used for deciding re-indexing).
	<li> Fix problem with some weird MIME messages (with null boundaries) which
	  crashed the indexer.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.5.6">1.5.6</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Small fixes dealing with the build process or compiler issues. 
	  1.5.6 has updated ukrainian and russian messages.
	  Otherwise no functional changes, and no need to upgrade from 1.5.1

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.5.1">1.5.1</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Fix serious bug with non ascii strings in simple search history
	<li> Improve synthetic abstracts: remove size limitations, handle overlapping
	  extracts, avoid printing several terms from the same position.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.5.0">1.5.0 2006-09-20</a></h2>
      <ul>

	<li> Added support for powerpoint and excel files, with the catdoc package.
	<li> Allow viewing consecutive documents from the result list inside a single
	  preview window using the shift-arrow-up and shift-arrow-down keys.
	<li> Colorize search terms in abstracts in the result list.
	<li> A number of elements are now remembered between program invocations:
	  sort criteria, list of ignored file types (always starts inactive), 
	  subtree restriction, better handling of the recent searches listbox, the
	  buildAbstract and replaceAbstract settings are not forgotten any more.
	<li> New option to automatically add a phrase to simple searches.
	<li> Possibility to adjust the length and context width for synthetic abstracts.
	<li> Handle weird html better.
	<li> When indexing mail messages, walk the full mime tree instead of staying
	  at the top level, index all text parts and attachement file names.
	<li> Add -c <confdir> option to recoll and recollindex to specify the
	    configuration directory on the command line
	    <li> Better synchronization between the active preview and the highlighted
	      paragraph inside the list
	    <li> Improved recall for some special cases of stemming.
	    <li> Much better handling of email dates, allowing better email sorting by
	      date (previously the message date was quite often the date when the file
	      was indexed).
	    <li> Store the external database lists in the configuration directory, not the
	      qt preferences.
	    <li> Ensure dialogs are sized according to font size


      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.4.3">1.4.3 2006-05-07</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Multiple search databases. 
	<li> Optionally auto-search when a word is entered in the simple search
	  field.
	<li> Show possible term completions in simple search by typing CTRL+TAB
	<li> Add 'more like this' option to result list right-click menu, to look for
	  documents related to the current result.
	<li> Double-click in preview or result list adds the selected word to the
	  simple search text field.
	<li> The simple search text entry field is now a combobox and remembers
	  previous searches.
	<li> Additional OR field in complex search.
	<li> Improved indexing cancellability (interrupting recollindex or closing 
	  recoll with an indexing thread active), and status reporting.
	<li> Fixed filters to handle file paths with embedded spaces.
	<li> Misc small bug and memory leaks fixes.
	<li> More compact result list.
	<li> Set mode 0700 on .recoll directory by default

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.3.3">1.3.3 2006-04-04</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Implement specific search on file names with wildcard
	  support. Indexation can optionally process all file names or only those
	  with mime types supported for normal indexation. UPDATING: you need a
	  full re-indexation to take advantage of this.
	<li> Use links and a right-click popup menu to replace confusing use of
	  mouse clicks and double-clicks inside the result list.
	<li> The 'example' configuration files are now used as default, and are not
	  copied any more to the user directory during installation. Overrides can
	  be set in the personal files for any value that the user wishes to
	  modify, with unchanged formats and file names (so that the files from
	  previous versions remain valid, but you may wish to trim them of values
	  that duplicate the central ones).
	<li> Use NLS information (LC_CTYPE, LANG) do determine default charset when
	  possible.
	<li> Mp3 file indexing, either filenames only or also id3 tags if id3info is
	  available. c/c++  ext edit. Use gnuclient instead of xemacs for text files.
	<li> Russian and Ukrainian translations and many improvement ideas thanks to
	  Michael Shigorin.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.2.3">1.2.3 2006-03-03</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Added support for dvi (with dvips), and dvu (with DjVuLibre).
	<li> Ensure that configure and make use the same qt version.
	<li> Fix sorted sequence title display.
	<li> Discriminate fatal errors and missing docs while loading a doc list.
	<li> Improved and cleaned up way to position a preview on the first search term.

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.2.2">1.2.2 2006-02-02</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Fix minor compilation glitches (FreeBSD 4, QT 3.1, xapian-config problem)

      </ul>
      <h2><a name="1.2.0">1.2.0 2006-02-01</a></h2>
      <ul>
	<li> Improved preview loading: don't highlight very big documents (over 1Mb),
	  allow cancellation while loading.
	<li> Abstracts generated in the result list by looking at search term
	  contexts. This can slow down result list display for big documents, and
	  can be turned off in the preferences menu.
	<li> Wrap query detail line displayed when clicking on result list header.
