CHANGES 

1.8.1 2007-02-20
- Add a small query language with some field-based searches (author, title,
  etc.)
- Add wildcard handling everywhere. *, ?, [] can be used in any
  search. Warning: using a wild card at the left of a term can make
  for a very slow search.
- Allow skipping specific paths during indexing (in addition to file name
  patterns)
- Improved external index choice dialog, accessible from the top-level menu.
- Many small bugs fixed: stemming language choice ignored in term explorer,
  qt4 preview window reentrancy crashes, issues with saving the default
  advanced search file, type filter, display more clearly missing helper
  errors, etc. 
- Option to use the desktop defaults (with xdg-open) to choose the native
  viewer for files (instead of recoll's mimeview). 

1.7.6 2007-01-30
 - Fixes an issue with the openoffice filter on debian systems. 
 - Adds Scribus and Lyx filters.

1.7.5 2007-01-15
 - Fixes two email indexing bugs in 1.7.3, which would bail out from an
   mbox folder on the first attachment filtering error, and would decline
   to handle multipart/signed bodies. You may need to run a full indexing
   pass (recollindex -z), to force reindexing of old folders.

1.7.3 2007-01-09
 - Email attachments are now indexed.
 - Right-click menu option to access the parent document of an embedded
   result (ie from mail attachment to parent message), or the parent folder
   of a given file (which is opened with the application configured for
   directories) 
 - The sort tool has been improved: no need to restart the query after sort
   criteria change. 
 - Support for real-time indexing with inotify is now enabled by default
   when appropriate.
 - Recoll now warns when the configured native viewer can not be found and
   starts an interface for chosing another one.
 - Categories (text, presentation, spreadsheets, etc.) can be used instead
   of raw mime types when filtering on file types in advanced search.
 - The port to qt4 is functional and can be enabled with configure --enable-qt4
 - 'autophrase' option improved and may now actually be useful.
 - Improved highlighting (again...)
 - Display term frequencies in term explorer.
 - Recollindex -e to remove data from index for listed files.
 - Directory names now indexed. Directories can be 'edited' with the
   configured application (rox by default)

1.6.3
 - Fixed problem with bad detection of mbox message boundaries.
   Upgrading can change the message numbering in some cases, and you should
   perform a full index update (recollindex -z) after installing
   the new version.
 - Fixed problem with execution of external viewer for files with
   single-quotes in the name.
1.6.2
 - Minor solaris compilation glitches only.
1.6.1
 - Term explorer: a multimode wildcard-regexp-spell/phonetic tool to search
   the index for terms. This uses aspell for the orthographic/phonetic part.
 - A more dynamic advanced search window. You now have a choice of the top
   level conjunction (OR/AND) and of any number of clauses, including NEAR
   and PHRASE clauses with an adjustable proximity parameter.
 - User-settable format for the result-list entries, which use an HTML
   string with %xx printf-like replacements (accessible from the user
   preferences).
 - Real time monitoring/indexing support. This is not configured by
   default, and must be specified at build time (configure --help).
 - Improved phrase/group highlighting in abstracts and preview
 - Better sample selection for synthetic abstracts.
 - Improved performance of the text splitter, good for indexing and previewing.
 - Shift+click link to open new preview window instead of tab in existing
   window.
 - The key sequence for term completion in the simple search entry was
   changed from CTRL+TAB to "Escape Space" to avoid interaction with window
   managers.
 - Improved recall for phrases with composite words like email addresses.


Updating from 1.2 to 1.3 or 1.4 or 1.5: 
---------------------------------------
From version 1.3 up, there is a new feature to search specifically for file
names (with wildcard processing). If you want to take full advantage of
this, you should perform a full reindex after installing the new version
(ie: use recollindex -z, or delete ~/.recoll/xapiandb).
Also, we now use the central copies of configuration files for default
values, and the user ones only for overrides. Your old configuration files
will still work, but, you may want to remove them if they are unmodified,
or keep only the modified parameters.

1.5.9 
- Fix bad timezone conversion in email dates. Display timezone in result
  list dates.

1.5.8
- Fix stored and displayed dates which used to come from the file's ctime,
  now use mtime (which was already used for deciding re-indexing).
- Fix problem with some weird MIME messages (with null boundaries) which
  crashed the indexer.

1.5.[23456]
- Small fixes dealing with the build process or compiler issues. 
  1.5.6 has updated ukrainian and russian messages.
  Otherwise no functional changes, and no need to upgrade from 1.5.1

1.5.1
- Fix serious bug with non ascii strings in simple search history
- Improve synthetic abstracts: remove size limitations, handle overlapping
  extracts, avoid printing several terms from the same position.

1.5.0 2006-09-20

- Added support for powerpoint and excel files, with the catdoc package.
- Allow viewing consecutive documents from the result list inside a single
  preview window using the shift-arrow-up and shift-arrow-down keys.
- Colorize search terms in abstracts in the result list.
- A number of elements are now remembered between program invocations:
  sort criteria, list of ignored file types (always starts inactive), 
  subtree restriction, better handling of the recent searches listbox, the
  buildAbstract and replaceAbstract settings are not forgotten any more.
- New option to automatically add a phrase to simple searches.
- Possibility to adjust the length and context width for synthetic abstracts.
- Handle weird html better.
- When indexing mail messages, walk the full mime tree instead of staying
  at the top level, index all text parts and attachement file names.
- Add -c <confdir> option to recoll and recollindex to specify the
  configuration directory on the command line
- Better synchronization between the active preview and the highlighted
  paragraph inside the list
- Improved recall for some special cases of stemming.
- Much better handling of email dates, allowing better email sorting by
  date (previously the message date was quite often the date when the file
  was indexed).
- Store the external database lists in the configuration directory, not the
  qt preferences.
- Ensure dialogs are sized according to font size


1.4.3 2006-05-07
 - Multiple search databases. 
 - Optionally auto-search when a word is entered in the simple search
   field.
 - Show possible term completions in simple search by typing CTRL+TAB
 - Add 'more like this' option to result list right-click menu, to look for
   documents related to the current result.
 - Double-click in preview or result list adds the selected word to the
   simple search text field.
 - The simple search text entry field is now a combobox and remembers
   previous searches.
 - Additional OR field in complex search.
 - Improved indexing cancellability (interrupting recollindex or closing 
   recoll with an indexing thread active), and status reporting.
 - Fixed filters to handle file paths with embedded spaces.
 - Misc small bug and memory leaks fixes.
 - More compact result list.
 - Set mode 0700 on .recoll directory by default

1.3.3 2006-04-04
 - Implement specific search on file names with wildcard
   support. Indexation can optionally process all file names or only those
   with mime types supported for normal indexation. UPDATING: you need a
   full re-indexation to take advantage of this.
 - Use links and a right-click popup menu to replace confusing use of
   mouse clicks and double-clicks inside the result list.
 - The 'example' configuration files are now used as default, and are not
   copied any more to the user directory during installation. Overrides can
   be set in the personal files for any value that the user wishes to
   modify, with unchanged formats and file names (so that the files from
   previous versions remain valid, but you may wish to trim them of values
   that duplicate the central ones).
 - Use NLS information (LC_CTYPE, LANG) do determine default charset when
   possible.
 - Mp3 file indexing, either filenames only or also id3 tags if id3info is
   available. c/c++  ext edit. Use gnuclient instead of xemacs for text files.
 - Russian and Ukrainian translations and many improvement ideas thanks to
   Michael Shigorin.

1.2.3 2006-03-03
 - Added support for dvi (with dvips), and dvu (with DjVuLibre).
 - Ensure that configure and make use the same qt version.
 - Fix sorted sequence title display.
 - Discriminate fatal errors and missing docs while loading a doc list.
 - Improved and cleaned up way to position a preview on the first search term.
1.2.2 2006-02-02
 - Fix minor compilation glitches (FreeBSD 4, QT 3.1, xapian-config problem)
1.2.0 2006-02-01
 - Improved preview loading: don't highlight very big documents (over 1Mb),
   allow cancellation while loading.
 - Abstracts generated in the result list by looking at search term
   contexts. This can slow down result list display for big documents, and
   can be turned off in the preferences menu.
 - Wrap query detail line displayed when clicking on result list header.
 - Text splitting cleanup with less spurious terms should result in
   slightly smaller databases.
 - Sligthly improved presentation in preview, esp. line breaks.
 - Color icons...
 - Let the user select the html browser used for help display.
 - autoconf/Makefile change: allow building UI from inside the qtgui
   directory. 
 - autoconf/Makefile: improved search and diagnostics for qt/qmake.
 - Internal code cleanup for maintainability: text splitting, user
   interface.
 - Added prototype kio_slave to show result inside Konqueror, doesn't seem
   particularly useful.
1.1.0 2006-01-12
 - A much better user manual, which can be browsed from the help menu.
 - man pages for recoll, recollindex, recoll.conf
 - User/query interface configuration dialog.
 - Click on result list header will display the exact boolean search which
   was used.
 - recollindex can be used to create stem expansion databases independantly
   of a full indexing pass.
 - Misc user interface improvements, like an 'all terms' checkbox for
   simple search.
 - Fixed case-insensitivity issues. Probably needs more testing.
1.0.16 2006-01-05
 - Minor installation tweaks for rpm compatibility
1.0.15 
 - Fix problems with prefix != /usr/local
 - Remove '.*' from the default list of ignored file/dir names: this
   prevented mozilla/thunderbird mail indexing. 
 - Fix some 64 bits issues
1.0.14
 - Small changes for FreeBSD 4 compilation.
1.0.13
 - Install of recollinstall program not done or needed any more.
1.0.12

   whenever the document charset name differed from the default only in 
   character case or punctuation.
1.0.11
 - Create personal configuration on first start.
 - Use qt toolbars.
 - Also index terms in file paths.
 - Tool for sorting on dates or mime types.
 - Fixed pdf filter which was broken by more recent xpdf

1.0.10
 - Added tool to manage the history of consulted documents.
 - Try harder to convert email messages with wrongly declared charsets.
 - Add option to reset the database before indexing (easier than rm -rf).
 - Small gui improvements.
 - Install partial french translation as a tease for future translaters...

1.0.8->1.0.9
 - Fixed 2 really ennoying bugs in 1.0.8: wouldn't preview 2nd document
   from same file + spurious db close when filter could not be executed.

1.0.5 -> 1.0.8

 - Option to use the system's 'file' command as a final step of
   identification for suffix-less or unknown files.
 - Typo had removed support for .Z compression
 - Use more appropriate conjonction operators when computing the advanced
   search query (OP_AND_MAYBE, OP_FILTER instead of OP_AND)
