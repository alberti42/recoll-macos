= Building Recoll on Microsoft Windows MinGW

This document describes building a Recoll distribution, starting from a
pristine Windows machine, using the http://www.mingw.org/[MinGW] port of gcc
and associated tools. 

The resulting package only needs Python and 7-zip to be installed on the
target system.

== Installing MinGW and MSYS

Download the installer from http://www.mingw.org/, and run it.

In the following, a number of commands will use a command window with an
MinGW environment. This can be easily created by executing
C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat from File Explorer.

Note: you should take care to use the gcc compiler which comes with Qt for
all the following builds. For this, you will want to execute the following
command in the command window:

    export PATH=c:/qt/tools/mingw492_32/bin:$PATH

== Tortoise HG

This is needed because there is no source package for recoll or its
dependancies for now, you are going to clone Bitbucket repositories.

Get it from http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/download/index.html

Then clone the repositories for
https://medoc@bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll[recoll] to C:/recoll and
https://medoc@bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll-windows-deps[some of the
dependancies] to C:/recolldeps

You can change the target names, but there will be more script editing
later on then (nothing much).

== Qt

Download and install Qt 5.5.x (mingw version) from: http://www.qt.io/download/

Note: it is not possible to build a static webkit, so the installation is
necessarily dynamic, which means that the Qt DLLS will need to be copied
into the installation directory. This is done by the installation-building
script (using `windeployqt`)


== zlib

Download from http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz
Then, from an MSYS command window (see above):

     cd c:/temp
     export PATH=c:/qt/tools/mingw492_32/bin:$PATH
     tar xzf path-to-tar-file
     cd zlib-1.2.8
     make -f win32/Makefile.gcc

== Xapian

Download from:
http://oligarchy.co.uk/xapian/1.2.21/xapian-core-1.2.21.tar.xz

    cd c:/recolldeps
    tar xf path-to-tar-file
    cd xapian-core-1.2.21

- Edit common/safeunistd.h to neutralize the sleep() function definition as
  this conflicts with the definition which is part of recent mingw
  editions. Replace the "#ifdef __WIN32__" with "#if 0". This is
  already fixed in later Xapian versions

Then: 

    export PATH=c:/qt/tools/mingw492_32/bin:$PATH
    CPPFLAGS=-IC:/temp/zlib-1.2.8 LDFLAGS=-Lc:/temp/zlib-1.2.8 ./configure
    make

== Recoll

You need to use the source from the repository, there is no release
supporting Windows at the moment.

- If not already done, clone the recoll repository from:
  https://medoc@bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll to `C:/recoll`

- Start qtcreator and open c:/recoll/src/windows/qmkrecoll/librecoll.pro At
  the bottom of the file, you may need to fix the locations for the xapian
  and zlib dlls.

- Build librecoll.pro

- Do the same (adjust locations and build) for:
  c:/recoll/src/windows/qmkrecoll/rclstartw.pro
  c:/recoll/src/windows/qmkrecoll/recollindex.pro
  c:/recoll/src/windows/qmkrecoll/recollq.pro
  c:/recoll/src/qtgui/recoll-win.pro


== Helper applications

There are a number of useful files stored in a BitBucket repository, you
will need to clone it on the windows machine (the final script,
mkinstdir.sh, expects C:/recolldeps as a cloned location).

    https://medoc@bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll-windows-deps

== 7-zip

7-zip is used for all decompression tasks. Install it from
http://www.7-zip.org/ 

== Python

All Recoll helper scripts (data extractors) are written in Python, and not
yet compatible with Python3. You need to install and download Python 2.7
from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/

== Python modules

Some data formats need library modules not delivered as part of the base
Python installation

=== libxml2/libxslt

The precompiled binary is from :
http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/
http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/binaries/libxml2-python-2.7.7.win32-py2.7.exe

The useful parts are stored in recoll-windows-deps repo

Slightly newer dlls, which should be compatible, here:
https://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html

This will be copied into the installation by the mkinstdir.sh script.

=== mutagen 

Download and extract mutagen from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mutagen
Then in the mutagen directory (e.g. C:/temp/mutagen-1.31):

     python setup.py build

=== pyexiv2

I did not attempt a build (needs boost-python, scons).
Used an installer from http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/download.html

The resulting site-packages data is stored in the recoll-windows-deps
directory and copied into the filters directory by the mkinstdir.sh script

=== epub 

Download from: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/epub/

Extract, then execute the following in the extracted directory (e.g.:
C:/temp/epub-0.5.2):
 
   python setup.py

The module will be copied by mkinstdir.sh


== Non-Python helpers

== unrtf 

I initially built unrtf with VS 2015, and I was too lazy to do it again
with mingw. The project files are in the Windows directory in the official
repository: 
            
    hg clone http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/unrtf/

== antiword

Use the source from recoll-windows-deps (C:/recolldeps/unrtf)

     make -f Makefile.mingw.

== Poppler

Did not try to compile. Used the binaries from 
http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/ 

There is a copy in the recoll-windows-deps repository, it will be copied by
the mkinstdir.sh script.

== Building the install directory


Once the builds above are performed, edit the mkinstdir.sh script to adjust
the locations, and use it to build the installation directory
