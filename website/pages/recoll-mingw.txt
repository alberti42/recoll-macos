= Building Recoll on Microsoft Windows with MinGW
Jean-Francois Dockes <jf at dockes.org>

This document describes building a Recoll distribution, starting from a
pristine Windows machine, using the http://www.mingw.org/[MinGW] port of gcc
and associated tools. 

The resulting package only needs Python (and optionally 7-zip) to be
installed on the target system.

== Installing MinGW and MSYS

Download the installer from http://www.mingw.org/, and run it.

In the following, a number of commands will use a command window with an
MinGW environment. This can be easily created by executing
C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat from File Explorer.

NOTE: you should take care to use the gcc compiler which comes with Qt for
all the following builds. For this, you will want to execute the following
command in the command window:

    export PATH=/c/qt/tools/mingw492_32/bin:$PATH

== Tortoise HG

This is needed because there is no source package for recoll or its
dependancies for now, you are going to clone Bitbucket repositories.

Get it from http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/download/index.html

Then clone the repositories for
https://medoc@bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll[recoll] to C:/recoll and
https://medoc@bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll-windows-deps[some of the
dependancies] to C:/recolldeps

You can change the target names, but there will be more script editing
later on then (nothing much).

== Qt

Download and install Qt 5.5.x (mingw version) from: http://www.qt.io/download/

Note: it is not possible to build a static webkit, so the installation is
necessarily dynamic, which means that the Qt DLLS will need to be copied
into the installation directory. This is done by the installation-building
script (using `windeployqt`)


== zlib

Download from http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz

Don't forget the PATH update if not done yet:

     export PATH=/c/qt/tools/mingw492_32/bin:$PATH

Then, from an MSYS command window (see above):

     cd c:/temp
     tar xzf path-to-tar-file
     cd zlib-1.2.8
     make -f win32/Makefile.gcc

== Xapian

Download from:
http://oligarchy.co.uk/xapian/1.4.1/xapian-core-1.4.1.tar.xz

Don't forget the PATH update if not done yet:

     export PATH=/c/qt/tools/mingw492_32/bin:$PATH

Then:

    cd c:/recolldeps
    tar xf path-to-tar-file
    cd xapian-core-1.4.1

- Edit common/safeunistd.h to neutralize the sleep() function definition as
  this conflicts with the definition which is part of recent mingw
  editions. Replace the "#ifdef __WIN32__" with "#if 0". This is
  already fixed in later Xapian versions

Then: 

    CPPFLAGS=-I/c/temp/zlib-1.2.8 LDFLAGS=-L/c/temp/zlib-1.2.8 ./configure
    make

== Recoll

You need to use the source from the repository, there is no release
supporting Windows at the moment.

- If not already done, clone the recoll repository from:
  https://medoc@bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll to `C:/recoll`

- Start `QtCreator` and open
  `c:/recoll/src/windows/qmkrecoll/librecoll.pro`. At the bottom of the
  file, you may need to fix the locations for the xapian and zlib dlls.

- Build librecoll.pro

- Do the same (adjust locations and build) for:

  c:/recoll/src/windows/qmkrecoll/rclstartw.pro
  c:/recoll/src/windows/qmkrecoll/recollindex.pro
  c:/recoll/src/windows/qmkrecoll/recollq.pro
  c:/recoll/src/qtgui/recoll-win.pro


== Helper applications

There are a number of useful files stored in a BitBucket repository, you
will need to clone it on the windows machine (the final script,
mkinstdir.sh, expects C:/recolldeps as a cloned location).

    https://medoc@bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll-windows-deps

== 7-zip

7-zip is used for all decompression tasks. Install it from
http://www.7-zip.org/ 

== Python

All Recoll helper scripts (data extractors) are written in Python, and not
yet compatible with Python3. You need to download and install Python 2.7
from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/

== Python modules

Some data formats need library modules not delivered as part of the base
Python installation

=== libxml2/libxslt

The precompiled binary is from :
http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/
http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/binaries/libxml2-python-2.7.7.win32-py2.7.exe

The useful parts are stored in recoll-windows-deps repo

Slightly newer dlls, which should be compatible, here:
https://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html

This will be copied into the installation by the mkinstdir.sh script.

=== mutagen 

Download and extract mutagen from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mutagen
Then in the mutagen directory (e.g. C:/temp/mutagen-1.32 where it is
expected by `mkinstdir.sh`):

     python setup.py build

The module will be copied by mkinstdir.sh

=== epub 

Download from: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/epub/

Extract, then execute the following in the extracted directory (e.g.:
`C:/temp/epub-0.5.2` which is expected by `mkinstdir.sh`):
 
   python setup.py

The module will be copied by mkinstdir.sh

=== pyexiv2

I did not attempt a build (needs boost-python, scons).
Used an installer from http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/download.html

The resulting site-packages data is stored in the recolldeps
repository and copied into the filters directory by the mkinstdir.sh
script. 


== Non-Python helpers

== unrtf 

The current unrtf sources can be built with MinGW.

    hg clone http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/unrtf/

    cd c:/unrtf/Windows
    make -f Makefile.mingw

== antiword

Use the source from recoll-windows-deps (C:/recolldeps/antiword)

     make -f Makefile.mingw.

== Poppler

Did not try to compile. Used the binaries from 
http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/ 

There is a copy in the recoll-windows-deps repository, it will be copied by
the mkinstdir.sh script.

== libwpd

We use the wpd2html tool from libwpd 0.10.0, unmodified. This depends on
librevenge 0.0.1 which has been slightly modified to not depend on boost (a
500 MB install if you can believe it). Both files can be found under the
libwpd directory of the recoll-windows-deps repository.

    mkdir c:/temp/libwpd
    cd c:/temp/libwpd

    tar xf librevenge-0.0.1.jfd.tar.gz
    cd librevenge-0.0.1.jfd
    CPPFLAGS=-I/c/temp/zlib-1.2.8 LDFLAGS=-L/c/temp/zlib-1.2.8 configure --disable-tests --without-docs
    make

    cd ..

    tar xf /c/recolldeps/libwpd/libwpd-0.10.0.tar.gz
    cd libwpd-0.10.0
    REVENGE_CFLAGS=-Ic:/temp/libwpd/librevenge-0.0.1.jfd/inc \
    REVENGE_LIBS="-Lc:/temp/libwpd/librevenge-0.0.1.jfd/src/lib/.libs -lrevenge-0.0" \
    REVENGE_GENERATORS_CFLAGS=-Ic:/temp/libwpd/librevenge-0.0.1.jfd/inc \
    REVENGE_GENERATORS_LIBS="-Lc:/temp/libwpd/librevenge-0.0.1.jfd/src/lib/.libs -lrevenge-generators-0.0" \
    REVENGE_STREAM_CFLAGS=-Ic:/temp/libwpd/librevenge-0.0.1.jfd/inc \
    REVENGE_STREAM_LIBS="-Lc:/temp/libwpd/librevenge-0.0.1.jfd/src/lib/.libs -lrevenge-stream-0.0" \
    configure --without-docs
    make

== chm

This build uses a slightly modified pychm python modules: for
simplification, the relevant C files from chmlib were included in the
python module itself (in addition to its own C extension file).

The source package is inside the recoll-windows-deps repository as
pychm-0.8.4.1-git.tar.gz. The build result is also stored, and will be used
directly by the install building script, so the following instructions are
for reference.

To build the pychm module:

    cd c:/temp
    tar xf pychm-0.8.4.1-git.tar.gz
    cd pychm-0.8.4.1-git
    python setup.py build
    
Will probably complain about a missing vc++ compiler, and indicate where to
download VC++ for Python 2.7 (an official Microsoft location). Do it, then
repeat the command:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py bdist

This creates a zip file inside the dist subdirectory. The contents of this
zip are extracted and the chm/ directory is stored in the
recoll-windows-deps repo for convenience (under pychm/chm) and copied to
the recoll install dir by the install script.

== Building the install directory

Once the builds above are performed, edit the mkinstdir.sh script to adjust
the locations, and use it to build the installation directory. The
innosetup script expects it to be c:/install/recoll

== Building the setup executable

Install Inno Setup and use src/windows/recoll-setup.iss to generate the
installation executable.
