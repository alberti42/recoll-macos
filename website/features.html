      <h2><a name="systems">Supported systems</a></h2>

      <p><span class="application">Recoll</span> has been compiled
      and tested on FreeBSD, Linux, Darwin and Solaris (initial
      versions FreeBSD 5, Redhat 7, Fedora Core 5, Suse 10, Gentoo,
      Debian 3.1, Solaris 8). It should compile and run on all
      subsequent releases of these systems and probably a few
      others too.</p>

      <p>Qt versions from 3.1 to 4.7</p>

      <h2><a name="doctypes">Document types</a></h2>

      <p>Recoll can index many document types (along with their
      compressed versions). Some types are handled internally (no
      external application needed). Other types need a separate
      application to be installed to extract the text. Types that
      only need very common utilities (awk/sed/groff etc.) are
      listed in the native section.</p>

      <h4>File types indexed natively</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="literal">text</span>.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">html</span>.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">maildir</span> and <span class=
        "literal">mailbox</span> (<span class=
        "literal">Mozilla</span>, <span class=
        "literal">Thunderbird</span> and <span class=
        "literal">Evolution</span> mail ok).</li>

        <li><span class="literal">gaim</span> and <span class=
        "literal">purple</span> log files.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Lyx</span> files (needs <span
        class="literal">Lyx</span> to be installed).</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Scribus</span> files.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Man pages</span> (need <span
        class="command">groff</span>).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>File types indexed with external helpers</h4>

      <p>Many document types need the <span class="command">iconv</span>
      command in addition to the applications specifically listed.</p>

      <p>The following types need <span class=
      "command">xsltproc</span> from the <b>libxslt</b> package.
      Quite a few also need <span class="command">unzip</span>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="literal">Abiword</span> files.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Fb2</span> ebooks.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Kword</span> files.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Microsoft Office Open XML</span>
        files.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">OpenOffice</span> files.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">SVG</span> files.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Others:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="literal">pdf</span> with the <span class=
        "command">pdftotext</span> command, which can be installed
        as part of <a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/">xpdf</a>
        or <a href="http://poppler.freedesktop.org/">poppler</a>,
        depending on your distribution.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">msword</span> with <a href=
        "http://www.winfield.demon.nl/">antiword</a>.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Powerpoint</span> and <span
        class="literal">Excel</span> with the <a href=
        "http://catdoc.klik.atekon.de">catdoc</a> utilities.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">CHM (Microsoft help)</span> files
        (needs <span class="command">Python, pychm or
        chmlib</span>).</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Zip</span> archives (needs <span
        class="command">Python</span>).</li>

        <li><span class="literal">iCalendar</span>(.ics) files
        (needs <span class="command">Python, <a href=
        "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar/2.1">icalendar</a></span>).</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Mozilla calendar data</span> See
        <a href=
        "http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/IndexMozillaCalendari">
        the wiki</a> about this.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">Wordperfect</span> with <a href=
        "http://libwpd.sourceforge.net">libwpd</a>.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">postscript</span> with <a href=
        "http://www.gnu.org/software/ghostscript/ghostscript.html">ghostscript</a>
        and <a href=
        "http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/pstotext.htm">pstotext</a>.
        Actually the pstotext 1.9 found at the latter link has a
        problem with file names using special shell characters, and
        you should either use the version packaged for your system
        which is probably patched, or apply the Debian patch which
        is stored <a href=
        "files/pstotext-1.9_4-debian.patch">here</a> for
        convenience. See
        http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/pstotext and
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=356988 for
        references/explanations.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">RTF</span> files with <a href=
        "http://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/unrtf.html">unrtf</a>. Please
        note that up to version
        0.21, <span class="command">unrtf</span> mostly does not work
        with non western-european character sets. If you have a need
        for indexing, ie, russian or chinese RTF files, I have
        produced a modified version which works much better (as
        indicated by my tests and a few external ones). You can
        download the <a href="unrtf/unrtf-0.22.0beta.tar.gz">source
        here</a>. The development is hosted
        on <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org/medoc/unrtf-int">
         bitbucket.org</a>.</li>  

        <li><span class="literal">TeX</span> with <span class=
        "command">untex</span>. If there is no untex package for
        your distribution, <a href="untex/untex-1.3.jf.tar.gz">a
        source package is stored on this site</a> (as untex has no
        obvious home). Will also work with <a href=
        "http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/trinkle/detex/">detex</a>
        if this is installed.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">dvi</span> with <a href=
        "http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html">dvips</a>.</li>

        <li><span class="literal">djvu</span> with <a href=
        "http://djvu.sourceforge.net">DjVuLibre</a>.</li>

        <li>Audio file tags: Recoll releases 1.13 and older use <a
        href="http://id3lib.sourceforge.net/">id3info (id3lib)</a>
        (compiling id3lib on recent systems may need a small patch,
        see <a href="id3lib.html">here.</a>) or the ogg and flac
        tools.<br>
         Recoll releases 1.14 and later use a Python filter based
        on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/">mutagen</a>
        for all audio types.</li>

        <li>Image file tags support with <a href=
        "http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">exiftool</a>.
        This is a perl program, so you also need perl on the
        system. This works with about any possible image file and
        tag format (jpg, png, tiff, gif etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other features</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Can use <b>Beagle</b> browser plug-ins to index web
        history. See the <a href=
        "http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/IndexBeagleWeb">the
        Wiki</a> for more detail.</li>

        <li>Processes all email attachments.</li>

        <li>Multiple selectable databases.</li>

        <li>Powerful query facilities, with boolean searches,
        phrases, filter on file types and directory tree.</li>

        <li>Xesam-compatible query language.</li>

        <li>Wildcard searches (with a specific and faster function
        for file names).</li>

        <li>Support for multiple charsets. Internal processing and
        storage uses Unicode UTF-8.</li>

        <li><a href="#Stemming">Stemming</a> performed at query
        time (can switch stemming language after indexing).</li>

        <li>Easy installation. No database daemon, web server or
        exotic language necessary.</li>

        <li>An indexer which runs either as a thread inside the
        GUI, as an external, batch, cron'able program, or as a
        real-time indexing daemon.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="#stemming"></a>Stemming</h2>

      <p>Stemming is a process which transforms inflected words
      into their most basic form. For example, <i>flooring</i>,
      <i>floors</i>, <i>floored</i> would probably all be
      transformed to <i>floor</i> by a stemmer for the English
      language.</p>

      <p>In many search engines, the stemming process occurs during
      indexing. The index will only contain the stemmed form of
      words, with exceptions for terms which are detected as being
      probably proper nouns (ie: capitalized). At query time, the
      terms entered by the user are stemmed, then matched against
      the index.</p>

      <p>This process results into a smaller index, but it has the
      grave inconvenient of irrevocably losing information during
      indexing.</p>

      <p>Recoll works in a different way. No stemming is performed
      at query time, so that all information gets into the index.
      The resulting index is bigger, but most people probably don't
      care much about this nowadays, because they have a 100Gb disk
      95% full of binary data <em>which does not get
      indexed</em>.</p>

      <p>At the end of an indexing pass, Recoll builds one or
      several stemming dictionaries, where all word stems are
      listed in correspondence to the list of their
      derivatives.</p>

      <p>At query time, by default, user-entered terms are stemmed,
      then matched against the stem database, and the query is
      expanded to include all derivatives. This will yield search
      results analogous to those obtained by a classical engine.
      The benefits of this approach is that stem expansion can be
      controlled instantly at query time in several ways:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It can be selectively turned-off for any query term by
        capitalizing it (<i>Floor</i>).</li>

        <li>The stemming language (ie: english, french...) can be
        selected (this supposes that several stemming databases
        have been built, which can be configured as part of the
        indexing, or done later, in a reasonably fast way).</li>
      </ul>
