	<dd><span class="application">Recoll</span> has been compiled and
	  tested on FreeBSD, Linux, Darwin and Solaris (versions
	  FreeBSD 5-7, Redhat 7/8/9, Fedora Core 5-13, Suse 10/11,
	  Gentoo, Debian 3.1, Solaris 8/9/10. Other not too distant
	  releases should be ok too).</dd>

	<dd>Qt versions from 3.1 to 4.5</dd>

        <dt><a name="doctypes">Document types</a></dt>
	<dd>Recoll can index many document types (along with their
          compressed versions). Some types are handled internally (no
          external application needed). Other types need some application to
          be installed to extract the text. Types that only need common
          very common utilities (awk/sed/groff etc.) are listed in the
          native section.</dd>

      <h2><a name="#stemming"></a>Stemming</h2>

      <p>Stemming is a process which transforms inflected words into
      their most basic form. For example, <i>flooring</i>,
      <i>floors</i>, <i>floored</i> would probably all be transformed
      to <i>floor</i> by a stemmer for the English language.</p>

      <p>In many search engines, the stemming process occurs during
      indexing. The index will only contain the stemmed form of words,
      with exceptions for terms which are detected as being probably
      proper nouns (ie: capitalized). At query time, the terms entered
      by the user are stemmed, then matched against the index.</p>

      <p>This process results into a smaller index, but it has the
	grave inconvenient of irrevocably losing information during
	indexing.</p>

      <p>Recoll works in a different way. No stemming is performed at
	query time, so that all information gets into the index. The
	resulting index is bigger, but most people probably don't care
	much about this nowadays, because they have a 100Gb disk 95%
	full of binary data <em>which does not get indexed</em>.</p>
      <p>At the end of an indexing pass, Recoll builds one or several
	stemming dictionaries, where all word stems are listed in
	correspondence to the list of their derivatives.</p>

      <p>At query time, by default, user-entered terms are stemmed,
	then matched against the stem database, and the query is
	expanded to include all derivatives. This will yield search
	results analogous to those obtained by a classical engine.
	The benefits of this approach is that stem expansion can be
	controlled instantly at query time in several ways:
	<ul>
	<li>It can be selectively turned-off for any query term by
	  capitalizing it (<i>Floor</i>).</li>
	<li>The stemming language (ie: english, french...) can be
	  selected (this supposes that several stemming databases have
	  been built, which can be configured as part of the indexing,
	  or done later, in a reasonably fast way).</li>
      </ul>
