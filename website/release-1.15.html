      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.15.0/1.15.7</h1>

      <p><em>Notes:</em>
        <ul><li>1.15.1 is identical to 1.15.0 except for a very
          small modification to allow building with qt 4.4.</li>
        <li>1.15.2 fixes the GUI startup crash described below, and an
        issue with very long path elements, which manifested itself mainly
        while indexing the Beagle queue.</li>
        <li>1.15.5 fixes more crashes still in 1.15.2. See the 
        <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_15_2">BUGS</a> file</li>
        <li>1.15.6 and 1.15.7 almost exclusively fix build issues (except
        for the indication of the stemming language in the menu, fixed in
        1.15.7). If you are running 1.15.5, you probably don't need to
        upgrade.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p>There have been reports of the recoll 1.15 GUI crashing when
        starting up after an upgrade. This was fixed by making a
        backup of ~/.config/Recoll.org/recoll.conf and deleting it (Qt
        stores the QSettings for the recoll GUI in this file, things
        like the search history and mix GUI options).</p>

      <p>If the result list is displayed with strange indentations, try
      to completely clear the result list paragraph format (in query
      preferences) to reset it to the default. Next time you open query
      preferences, the new default format will be up, and you can make
      any desired changes.</p>
      <p>The support for Qt 3 has been removed in this version which
        uses only native Qt 4 interfaces. If your system has no
        support for Qt 4.4 or newer, you need to stick
        with <a href="download-1.14.html">Recoll 1.14</a>, which is
        still supported.</p>

      <p>The defaults for file name searches with multiple fragments
        changed from OR to AND: see the changes list below for more
        detail.</p> 

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: version 1.15/14/13
        indexes are mostly compatible with 1.11 indexes, but some new,
        relatively minor, features (ie: duplicates collapsing) depend
        on a full index rebuild. The 1.14 date search feature
        does <i>not</i> need an index rebuild, the data was already in
        the index. The new 1.15 table will not be able to display
        filenames without a full reindex (it does display the urls),
        except for some previous custom field configurations.</p>

	<br />If installing over 1.10 or older, you need a full
	rebuild. The best way to do this is to just delete the old
	<span class="filename">.recoll/xapiandb</span> directory,
	especially if the index was created by an older version.
	(ie: <tt>rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb/</tt>).  On very
	old indexes, <tt>recollindex&nbsp;-z</tt> may sometimes end
	with a <em>backend doesn't implement metadata</em> error,
	which is wasteful because you then need to delete xapiandb and
	run the indexing again.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.15.0 has major new GUI features and fixes a number
      of small bugs</p> 

      <ul>

      <li>The GUI has a new display for the result list inside a
        spreadsheet-like table, with configurable columns and sort by
        any column. The table header right-click menu has the <i>reset
        sort</i> function and column adding/removing.The "classical" look
        is still there, you can dynamically switch between list and
        table by clicking the table-like icon in the toolbar. </li>

      <li>The old sort tool is gone. There are now vertical arrows in
        the tool bar to directly sort by date ascending or descending,
        which was its only significant use.</li>

      <li>We added duplication indicators to the result list when results
        are collapsed because they have bit-for-bit identical
        contents. The indicater is the collapse count in parentheses,
        displayed just after the relevancy percentage.</li>

      <li>There is now a menu entry to clear search history.</li>

      <li>File name search: it used to be that multiple fragments
        where OR'ed together to perform the search. They are now AND'ed,
        which makes more sense in many cases (remembering several
        fragments of the file name but not the order), but means that a
        search for <tt>*.doc&nbsp;*.odt</tt> will always
        fail. Use <tt>ext:doc&nbsp;OR&nbsp; ext:odt</tt> instead.</li>

      <li>Autophrase now works with the query language where it makes
        sense.</li> 

      <li>Support for lyrics in midi karaoke files. Works
        better with the
        Python <a href="http://chardet.feedparser.org/">chardet</a>
        character encoding identification module.</li>
        
      <li>Support newer Purple/Pidgin logs using an html format.</li>

      <li>Support thunderbird extreme brokiness in handling the mbox
        format: naked "^From $" separators are now accepted
        with <tt>mhmboxquirks&nbsp;=&nbsp;tbird</tt>.</li>

      <li>A change of method for filtering on directory location makes
        it much more efficient and faster.</li>

      <li>The utf-8 file name is now a stored field by default.</li>
      
      <li>We now catch all exceptions in Python filters to avoid
        crash reports from the system on benign filter failures.</li>

      <li>Indexing now creates a lock/pid file inside the
        configuration directory.</li>

      <li>Fixed parallel build issue on FreeBSD.</li>


      </ul>
