        <p>The current version is 1.23.1. <a href="release-1.23.html">Release
            notes</a>.</p>

        <p>Recoll <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INSTALL">Installation
            / building manual</a>.</p>

        <p>The indexing filters used for some document types may need external
          packages not installed on your system by default, and not installed
          automatically with Recoll: <a href="features.html#doctypes">take a
            look at the list</a> and decide what you need to install.</p>

        <p>The Recoll term explorer tool in phonetic mode (marginally useful and
          optional) uses the <b>aspell</b> package, version 0.60
          (utf-8 support) or newer.</p>

        <p>If you find problems with this page, the package or its
          installation, <em>please</em> <a href="mailto:jfd@recoll.org">report
          them</a>.</p> 

        <h4>What do the release numbers mean?</h4>

        <p>The Recoll releases are numbered X.Y.Z. The X would only
          change for really major modifications like a big change in
          the index format, and possibly won't ever reach 2.</p>

        <p>Y is for functional modifications. These may bring bugs, so
          if you don't need the new features, you may want to wait a
          little, and especially skip the first release (X.Y.0), at
          least for a few weeks.</p>

        <p>Z changes for <a href="BUGS.html">bug fixes</a> only, and
          moving from X.Y.Z to X.Y.Z+u should in general involve
          little risk of regression. But, <em>any</em> change can
          bring problems, if you are not affected by the corrected
          bugs (check the <a href="release-1.21.html">release
          file</a>), there is probably no necessity to upgrade
          anyway.</p>

        <h3>Prerequisites for building from source:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>C++ compiler. Be aware that its absence sometimes
          manifests itself by quite cryptic messages.</li>

          <li><p>Xapian core development libraries. Most Linux
              distributions carry them in their package repository. Or
              you will find source and binary packages on
              the <a href="http://www.xapian.org/download.php">Xapian
              download page</a>.
              <br>
            <p><em>Note on building Xapian for older CPUs:</em> The build
              configurations for Xapian releases 1.0.21 and 1.2.1 or
              newer enable the use of SSE2 floating point
              instructions. These instructions are not available in
              CPUs older than Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon 64. When
              building for such a CPU, you need to add the
              --disable-sse flag to the Xapian library configure
              command. If this is not done, the problem signals itself
              by "Illegal instruction" crashes (SIGILL) in recollindex
              and recoll. </p>
          </li>
          <li>Qt development files: Qt 4.4, 5.3 or newer (5.2 not ok).</li>
          <li>Qt WebKit development files: these are quite often
            distributed apart from the main Qt libraries. It is
            possible to configure Recoll not to use Qt WebKit (see
            configure --help).</li>
          <li>zlib development files.</li>
          <li>X11 development files.</li>
          <li>Python development package: you can avoid needing this
            by configuring with --disable-python-module.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Source repository:</h3>

        <p>The <span class="application">Recoll</span> source
          repository is hosted
          on <a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/overview">
            bitbucket.org</a>. The trunk is usually a bit on the
          bleeding edge, but there is always a maintenance branch for
          the current production version.</p>

        <h3>Instructions for building</h3>

        <p>Normally, it's just:</p>
        <div class="code">./configure; make; make install</div>
        <p>If a bit more detail is needed, 
          <a href="http://www.recoll.org/usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INSTALL.BUILDING">
            there is some in the manual</a>.

      </div>

      <div id="packages">
        <h2><a name="packages">Packages</a></h2>

        <p>Packages or ports for Recoll are available in the standard
          repositories for many distributions.</p>

        <p>However they are often a bit older or built with older
          Xapian releases. Here follow some pointers to find newer
          packages for some distributions. In most cases, you will
          just need to use an alternate repository.</p>

        <h3><a name="debian">Debian</a></h3>

        <p>The Debian Recoll packages are usually fairly up to date, just use
          the appropriate Debian repository.</p>

        <p><i>Except they're not at the moment
        (2017-01)...</i>. Debian stable (Jessie) has Recoll 1.17.3. Debian
          testing has 1.22.4, and it may work on Jessie (or not...).
          In any case, I am maintaining a repository for packages
          built for Debian Jessie (it also has older 1.22 packages for
          Wheezy). The repository currently has recoll 1.23.x for
          Debian Intel 32 and 64 bits, and armhf. There is a separate
          repository for Raspbian Jessie, which is <em>not</em>
          compatible with vanilla Debian (!).</p>

        <p>To add the Debian or Raspbian repository to your sources:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>Download the public key used to validate the repositories:
            <div class="code">
wget -O - https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/key/jf@dockes.org.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
            </div>
          </li>
          
          <li>Create and edit <span class="filename">
              /etc/apt/sources.list.d/recoll.list</span>
            and add the following lines:<br>
            for Debian wheezy (debian 7.x, recoll 1.22.3):<br>
            <div class="code">
deb http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/debian/ wheezy main
deb-src http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/debian/ wheezy main
            </div>
            for Debian jessie (debian 8.x):<br>
            <div class="code">
deb http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/debian/ jessie main
deb-src http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/debian/ jessie main
            </div>
            for Raspbian jessie (raspbian 8.x):<br>
            <div class="code">
deb http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/raspbian/ jessie main
deb-src http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/raspbian/ jessie main
            </div>
          <li>Then:
            <div class="code">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install recoll python-recoll python3-recoll
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you prefer to manually install the packages, they are here:
          <a href="debian/pool/main/r/recoll/">
            debian/pool/main/r/recoll/</a><br/>
        </p>

        <h3><a name="ubuntu">Ubuntu</a></h3>

        <p>There are Personal Package Archives on launchpad.net for
          <a href="https://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/recoll-1.15-on">
            Recoll, kio-recoll and recoll-lens</a>. These were built
          from the latest versions, for the current set of supported Ubuntu
          versions. Procedure:</p>
        <div class="code">
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:recoll-backports/recoll-1.15-on
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install recoll
        </div>

        <p>The packages in the PPA now have a separate package for the Python
          extension, like the standard ones, so there should be no more
          conflict issues while switching from the PPA to the normal
          repositories and back.</p>

        <h3><a name="mint">Linux Mint</a></h3>

        <p>The Ubuntu PPA works perfectly for Mint 13 (and probably other releases
          too). Just follow the instructions for Ubuntu.</p>

        <h3>RPMS</h3>

        <p>You'll need to install the Xapian, Qt, Qt-Webkit and zlib development
          packages if you want use the source rpms.</p>

        <h3>Fedora</h3>

        <p>Recoll is present in the standard Fedora package repositories starting from
          F-12. Recoll packages in Fedora are usually fairly up to
          date. Please get in touch if you have a need for a Recoll package
          for Fedora.</p>

        <h3>CentOS 7.1</h3>

        <p>CentOS ships neither Xapian nor Recoll. <a href="centos71">Here are
            some packages.</a>. There are only x86_64 binaries
          for now, use the source rpm for other archs. As far as I know, the
          only specific issue is that CentOS does not seem to have the Qt
          WebKit module. The Recoll build uses QTextBrowser instead of a
          WebKit QWebView, so no Javascript or advanced CSS in the result list
          or snippets window for you.</p>


        <h3>OpenSUSE</h3>

        <p>Recoll is in the KDE:Extra repository. You just need to add the
          repository to your software
          sources (Yast2-&gt;software-&gt;Software repositories).<br>
          <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Extra/">
            Repository list (supported Suse versions)</a>. 
          After adding the appropriate repository to your software sources,
          you will be able to install recoll and kio_recoll from the software
          management interface. The Xapian dependancy will also be satisfied
          from the build service repository. Some of the older repositories do
          not build antiword, just tell the software manager to "break" recoll
          by installing anyway, and get antiword somewhere else.</p>

      <div id="windows">
        <h2><a name="windows">Microsoft Windows Setup Files</a></h2>

        <p>The port of Recoll to Windows is still a bit experimental and
          lacking things like real-time indexing or spelling
          suggestions. However it works well enough to be useful. More info
          and links to the setup
          files <a href="pages/recoll-windows.html">here</a>.</p>

      <div id="ports">
        <h2><a name="ports">Ports</a></h2>

        <h3>Mac port</h3>

        <p>It seems that Recoll will sometimes find data that Spotlight misses
          (especially inside pdfs apparently, which is probably more to the credit of
          poppler than recoll itself).</p>

        <p>Recoll is in MacPorts and really easy to install:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://trac.macports.org/wiki/InstallingMacPorts">Install
              MacPorts</a>.</li>
          <li>Type "sudo port install recoll"</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Recoll is then available from the command line and as an icon in the usual
          MacPorts applications place.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="filters">
        <h2><a name="filters">Updated filters</a></h2>
        <p><a href="filters/filters.html">new or updated filters</a>
          sometimes become available after a release. As a rule, all
          filters are compatible with all Recoll versions. Any

      <div id="translations">
        <h2><a name="translations">Translations</a></h2>

        <p>Most of the translations for 1.22/23 are incomplete The source
          translation files are included in the source release. If
          your language has some english messages left and you want to
          take a shot at fixing the problem, you can send the results
          to <a href="mailto:jfd@recoll.org">me</a> and earn my
          gratefulness (and your less multilingual
          compatriot's)...</p>

        <p>You can use the <em>.ts</em> file to alter the translations
          if you wish (use Qt's <em>linguist</em> tool to edit the
          source file, then <em>lrelease</em> to produce
          the <em>.qm</em> file.). The <em>.qm</em> file should be copied

        <p><a href="translations/recoll_xx.ts">recoll_xx.ts</a> is a blank
