      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.21.x</h1>

      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.19 </p>

      <p>1.20 and 1.21 indexes are fully compatible. Installing 1.21
        over an 1.19 index is possible, but there have been small
        changes in the way compound words (e.g. email addresses) are
        indexed, so it will be best to reset the index. Still, in a
        pinch, 1.21 search can mostly use an 1.19 index. </p>

      <p>Always reset the index if you do not know by which version it
        was created (you're not sure it's at least 1.18). The best method
        is to quit all Recoll programs and delete the index directory 
        (<span class="literal">
          rm -rf ~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then start <code>recoll</code>
        or <code>recollindex</code>. <br> 

        <span class="literal">recollindex -z</span> will do the same
        in most, but not all, cases. It's better to use
        the <tt>rm</tt> method, which will also ensure that no debris
        from older releases remain (e.g.: old stemming files which are
        not used any more).</p>

      <p>Case/diacritics sensitivity is off by default. It can be
        turned on <em>only</em> by editing
        recoll.conf (
        <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
          see the manual</a>). If you do so, you must then reset the
        index.</p> 

      <h2>Minor releases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1.21.1: 
        <ul>
          <li>Force memory usage limits on external filters.</li>
          <li>GUI: add Ctrl+l as a shortcut to return focus to the
            search entry (compat with web browsers).</li>
          <li>result list popup allows saving results from web cache
            to files.</li>
          <li>The web history indexer also processes non-html files
            (e.g.: pdfs).</li>
          
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes in Recoll 1.21.0</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Allow saving queries to files and reloading them
          later. Available both for simple and advanced queries, and
          based on XML files.</li>
	<li>A Bison-based query parser replaces the old regexp-based
	  one and allows parenthized sub-expressions and easier future
	  expansions.</li>  
        <li>The GUI gets a "close to system tray" function.</li>
        <li>Avoid retrying to index previously indexed files if
          nothing seems to have changed in the filters.</li> 
        <li>Improve indexing speed by always using vfork() for
          spawning external commands.</li> 
        <li>The pdf filter gains the capability to run OCR (tesseract) on
          image-only files. This happens automatically on image-only
          pdfs if tesseract is available.</li> 
        <li>Improved checks about when we should try to uncompress
          stuff. Will eliminate some of the most dreadful cases of
          recollindex having an impact on system performance.</li>
        <li>Warn if non-existent paths are listed in the configuration
          file (help with typos).</li>
        <li>Adjust background color for webkit-based elements (result
          list and snippets window) according to desktop setup.</li>
        <li>Listing the results with the KIO slave is now
          performed with incremental updates. Bumped max entries to
          10000.</li>
      </ul>
