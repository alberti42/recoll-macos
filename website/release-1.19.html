      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.19.x</h1>


      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.19 
        </p>

      <p>Case/diacritics sensitivity is still off by default for this
        release. It can be turned on <em>only</em> by editing recoll.conf
        (<a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
          see the manual</a>). If you do so, you must then reset the index.</p>

      <p>Always reset the index if you do not know by which version it
        was created (you're not sure it's 1.18). The simplest way to
        do this is to quit all recoll programs and just delete the
        index directory
        (<span class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>),
        then start recoll or
        recollindex.  <span class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span>
        &nbsp;will do the same in most, but not all, cases, it's
        better to use the <tt>rm</tt> method, which will also ensure
        that no debris from older releases remain (e.g.: old stemming
        files which are not used any more).</p>

      <p><span class="important">Viewer exceptions</span>: 
        There is a new list of mime types that should be opened with
        the locally configured application even when <em>Use
          Desktop Preferences</em> is checked. This allows making
        use of new functions (direct access to page), which could not
        be available through the desktop's <tt>xdg-open</tt>.  The
        default list contains PDF, Postscript and DVI, which should be
        opened with the <em>evince</em> (or <em>atril</em> for
        Mint/MATE users) viewer for the page access functions to
        work. If you want to keep the previous behaviour (losing the
        page number functionality), you need to prune the list after
        installation . This can be done from the <em>Preferences->Gui
        Configuration</em> menu.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.19 .... Changes documented from 1.18.1 to rev 3159</p> 

      <ul>
        <li>There are new GUI configuration options to run in "search
          as you type" mode, and to disable the Qt auto-completion
          inside the simple search string, which was often more confusing
          and ennoying than useful.</li>

        <li>The software can now be built so that indexing is runs with
        multiple threads. This can be a major performance boost for
        people with multiprocessor machines and big indexes. It is not
        enabled by default for now, you will need to build from
        source. I wrote some 
          <a href="http://www.recoll.org/idxthreads/threadingRecoll.html">notes
            about the transformation and the performance improvements</a>.</li>

        <li>The Python module has been expanded to include the
          interface for extracting data. This means that you could now
          write most of the Recoll GUI in Python if you wished. There
          is
          a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/src/5b4bd9ef26a1/src/python/samples/recollgui/qrecoll.py?at=default">bit
          of sample code</a> in the source package doing just this. A
          few incompatible changes had to be made to the Python
          module. Especially the "Query.next" field is gone and the
          module structure has been changed (different import
          statement needed). Adapting your code is trivial, have a
          look at the changes in
          the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/src/5b4bd9ef26a10912bf8bd833fe6c084bd5a7bdbd/src/desktop/unity-lens-recoll/recollscope/rclsearch.py?at=default">Unity
          Lens module</a> for an example. The new module is compatible
          with
          the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/">Python
          Database API Specification v2.0</a> for the parts that make
          sense for a non-relational DB.</li>

        <li>You can now access your Recoll indexes through a Web
          browser interface. The server side is based on
          the <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">Bottle Python
            Web frameork</a> and the Recoll Python module, and can run
            self-contained (no necessity to run apache or another web
            server), so it's quite simple to set up. See:
          the expanded Python module. See
          the <a href="https://github.com/koniu/recoll-webui/">Recoll
          WebUI</a> on GitHub. </li>

        <li>Recoll now uses a dynamic library for the code shared by
          the query interface, the indexer and the Python
          module. This should have no visible impact but was rendered
          necessary by the Python module evolutions.</li>

        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
