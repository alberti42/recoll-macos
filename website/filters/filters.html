      <h1>Updated filters for Recoll</h1>
      
      <p>The following describe new and updated filters, which will be
        part of the next release, but can be installed on an older
        release if you need them.</p>

      <p>For updated filters, you just need to copy the script to the
        filters directory which may be typically either <span
      class="filename">/usr/share/recoll/filters</span>, or <span
      class="filename">/usr/local/share/recoll/filters</span>. Please check
      that the script is executable after copying it, and make it so if
      needed (chmod a+x <i>scriptname</i>)</p>

      <p>For new filters, you'll need to copy the script file as
	above, possibly install the supporting application, and usually
	edit the 
	<span class="filename">mimemap</span>, 
	<span class="filename">mimeview</span> and
	<span class="filename">mimeconf</span> files, either in the
	shared directory
	(<span class="filename">
	  /usr[/local]/share/recoll/examples</span>), or 
	in your personal configuration directory 
	(<span class="filename">$HOME/.recoll</span> or 
	<span class="filename">$RECOLL_CONFDIR</span>).</p>
      
      <p>Alternatively, you can replace your system files with
	these updated and complete versions:
	<a href="mimemap">mimemap</a>
	<a href="mimeconf">mimeconf</a> 
	<a href="mimeview">mimeview</a>.</p>

      <p>There is a slightly more detailed description of the filter
      installation procedure on the 
       <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/FilterRetrofit.wiki">
      Recoll Wiki</a>.</p>

      <p>The following entries are in reverse chronologic order. Each
        lists the latest Recoll release on which the update makes sense
        (newer releases have an up to date version of the filter).</p>
      
      <p>However, if you are running a Recoll version older than 1.17,
        you should really upgrade.</p>

      <h2>Attachments to PDF documents (1.20 and older)</h2>

      <p>A new <a href="rclmpdf">rclmpdf</a> filter for processing
        PDF files with attachments. This replaces the old <b>rclpdf</b>
        filter. You need to add it to ~/.recoll/mimeconf until it is
        made standard (this is still a bit experimental, and a big
        change from the previous filter):
        <pre><tt>
        [index]
        application/pdf = execm rclmpdf
        </tt></pre>
        Note the <tt>execm</tt> instead of <tt>exec</tt>. </p>  

      <h2><a name="soff1">Open/Libre-Office documents (1.19 and older)</a></h2>

      <p><a href="rclsoff">rclsoff</a>: the previous version did not
        produce white space between input tab-separated words, leading
        to search failures.</p>


      <h2>Purple logs (1.20 and older)</h2>

      <p>New <a href="rclpurple">rclpurple</a> filter for Pidging and
        other chat applications log files. Handles newer log
        formats. </p>  

      <h2>PowerPoint documents (1.19 and older)</h2>

      <p>The <b>rclppt</b> filter was based on <b>catppt</b>, but this
        seems to fail quite often on newer PPT
        documents. The new version is based on code from
        the <b>libreoffice</b> <b>mso-dump</b> project. It is both
        reasonably fast and quite thorough.
      </p> 

      <p>Installation:<ul>
          <li>As <tt>recollindex</tt> was executing <b>catppt</b>
            directly in the default configuration, you will also need to add
            the following to
            the <tt>mimeconf</tt> file (e.g.: ~/.recoll/mimeconf):
<pre>
  [index]
  application/vnd.ms-powerpoint = exec rclppt
</pre>
</li>
          <li>Copy the 3 following files to the Recoll filters directory (e.g:
            <i>/usr/share/recoll/filters</i>) and make sure
            that <tt>ppt-dump.py</tt> and <tt>rclppt</tt> are executable.
            <ul>
              <li><a href="rclppt">rclppt</a></li>
              <li><a href="ppt-dump.py">ppt-dump.py</a></li>
              <li><a href="msodump.zip">msodump.zip</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>EPUB documents (1.17 and older)</h2>

      <p>New <a href="rclepub">rclepub</a> filter for EPUB documents.
        This needs
        the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/epub/0.5.0">
          python epub decoding module</a>. </p> 

      <h2>CHM files (1.17.1 and older)</h2>
      <p><a href="rclchm">rclchm</a>. The previous version of the
        filter mishandled files which had encoded internal URLs (not
        very frequent, but happens).</p>

      <h2>Updated Open Document filter (1.17 and older)</h2>

      <p>The <a href="rclsoff">new filter</a> will correctly handle
      exported Google Docs documents and also Open/LibreOffice ones in
      some cases. The previous filters concatenated all the text
      inside the exported Google docs without any spacing...</p>

      <h2>TAR archives (1.17 and older)</h2>

      <p>New <a href="rcltar">rcltar</a> filter for tar archives. The
        indexing of tar archives is disabled by default in the sample
        configuration (stored here). This is an <tt>execm</tt>
        filter&nbsp;!.  You'll need to add an <br>
        <tt>application/x-tar = execm rcltar</tt><br>
        line in the [index] section of your
        $HOME/mimeconf to enable it, not an <tt>exec</tt> one.</p>

      <h2>XML files (1.17 and older)</h2>

      <p>By default, the current recoll version does not index xml
        content (except for known formats like dia, svg etc.). This
        new <a href="rclxml">rclxml</a> filter will extract the data
        from any xml file. Only text data is extracted, no attribute
        values. The other option is to treat xml file as plain text
        one (see comment in mimeconf), and index everything, including
        a lot of garbage.</p>

      <h2>DIA files (1.16 and older)</h2>
      <p><a href="rcldia">rcldia</a> is a new filter
        for <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/dia/">Dia</a> files,
        contributed by Stefan Friedel.</p>


      <h2>Okular annotations (1.16 and older)</h2>
      <p><a href="rclokulnote">rclokulnote</a>. Okular lets you create
        annotations for PDF documents and stores them in xml format
        somewhere under ~/.kde. This filter does not do a nice job to
        format the data, but will at least let you find it...</p>

      <h2>Gnumeric (1.16 and older)</h2>
      <p><a href="rclgnm">rclgnm</a>. Needs xsltproc and
      gunzip. As <tt>.gnumeric</tt> was in the list of
      explicitely ignored suffixes, you can't just add the mime
      and indexer script lines to your local mimemap and mimeconf, you
      also need to define recoll_noindex in the local mimemap (to
        override the system one which
        contains <tt>.gnumeric</tt>). The simplest approach may be to
        just replace the system files with those above.</p>

      <h2>Rar archive support (1.15 and older)</h2>
      <p><a href="rclrar">rclrar</a>. This is up to date in Recoll
        1.16.2 but may be added to Recoll 1.15. It needs the Python
               rarfile module. </p> 

      <h2>Mimehtml support (1.15)</h2>
      <p>This is based on the internal mail filter, you just need to
        download and install the configuration files (mimemap and
        mimeconf. Will only work with 1.15 and later.</p>

      <h2>Konqueror webarchive (.war) filter (1.15)</h2>
      <p><a href="rclwar">rclwar</a></p>

      <h2>Updated zip archive filter (1.15)</h2>
      <p>The filter is corrected to handle utf-8 paths in zip archives: 
        <a href="rclzip">rclzip</a>. Up to date in Recoll 1.16, but
        may be useful with Recoll 1.15</p>

      <h2>Updated audio tag filter (1.14)</h2>
      <p>The mutagen-based rclaudio filter delivered with recoll 1.14.2
	used a very recent mutagen interface which will only work with
	mutagen versions after 1.17 (probably. at least works with 1.19,
	doesn't with 1.15).
	You can download the <a href="rclaudio">corrected script
	here. Not useful with Recoll 1.5 or 1.6</a>.
