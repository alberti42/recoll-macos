      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.17.x</h1>


      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.17 is fully
        compatible with 1.16 indexes, and mostly compatible with 1.15
        ones, except for a few differences for weird terms containing
        punctuation signs. Perform a full index pass if installing
        over an older version. The simplest way to do this is to quit
        all recoll programs and just delete the index directory
        (<span class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>),
        then start recoll or
        recollindex.  <span class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span>
        will do the same in most cases.</p>

       <p>Also, using the anchored search feature on an 1.15 index
         requires a full reindex.</p> 


      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.17 is an incremental improvements release over 1.16, no
        really major function was introduced or modified.</p> 

      <ul>
        
        <li>Recoll now supports filtering on file sizes. This is accessible
          from the advanced search panel, or from the query langage
          (ie: "size&gt;10k&nbsp;size&lt;1m"). For documents stored
          inside archives, the file size stored in the index is now
          the actual one, not the archive's as was previously the
          case.</li>

        <li>Query language: tilde is now expanded inside a "dir:"
          clause.</li>

        <li>Query language: the "dir:" directive now accepts
          non-absolute paths. For example dir:dir1/dir2 will select
          any file the path of which includes "dir1/dir2".</li>

        <li>GUI: when a search fails to retrieve results, the spelling
          suggestions are now presented as links inside the result list
          area. Clicking a link will replace the appropriate word inside
          the search entry.</li>

        <li>GUI: thumbnails will be displayed in the result list if
          found in the standard freedesktop thumbnails directory
          (previously created by gimp or some file manager). Recoll
          will not create thumbnails (this would slow the results display
          too much).</li>

        <li>GUI: it is now possible to control the date format used to
          display the results (go to Query Preferences).</li>

        <li>GUI: it is now possible to Copy/Paste from the term explorer
          result list.</li>

        <li>GUI: it is now possible to use a Qt style sheet to modify
          many aspects of Recoll appearance. A style sheet file can be
          selected from the GUI query configuration dialog. A sample
          skeleton style sheet is to be found in the
          share/recoll/examples directory.</li>

        <li>GUI: added menu entry to show all the mime types actually
          indexed.</li>

        <li>GUI: the result list is now based on the WebKit widget
          instead of QTextBrowser. This means better html/css support,
          and even Javascript ... You can force the use the old
          QTextBrowser instead by using configure&nbsp;--disable-webkit.</li>

        <li>GUI: use Shift+PageUp instead of Shift+Home to rewind the
          result list to the first page. Shift+Home is useful in the
          search entry.</li>
   
        <li>The GUI now has a set of dialogs to set up the indexing
          schedule, either as automatic real time indexing started
          with the user session or as discrete cron entries. This
          will take care of the details of autostart files or crontab
          editing.</li> 

        <li>The GUI indexing thread has been removed. All indexing is
          now performed by a separate recollindex process. This has
          multiple advantages, the thread was just a very bad
          idea. Among others, exiting the GUI has no influence on an
          ongoing indexing.</li>

        <li>The GUI now has a menu entry to force a full reindex.</li>

        <li>The GUI indexing configuration now only shows the directories
          customized by the user, not those which come from the
          standard configuration (ie: ~/.thunderbird). Showing the
          standard directories was more often confusing than
          useful.</li>

        <li>GUI: the default reslist paragraph now displays the ipath:
          this is very useful for archive members and not too
          disturbing for other kinds.</li>

        <li>GUI: it is now possible to cancel a query that takes too
          long. Because of limitations in Xapian, this forces a program
          exit, but it's probably better than staring at a hung
          Recoll.</li>

        <li>GUI: what used to be the document category filters
          (media/text/etc.) are now defined as query language
          fragments inside mimeconf. This means that you can redefine
          them freely (see the comments for the [guifilters] section
          in the default mimeconf).</li>

        <li>Command line query: can now select a result slice
          (first result rank and count of results).</li>

        <li>Indexer: handle the html5 <tt>charset</tt> meta tag.</li>

        <li>Real time indexer: restart automatically when the
          configuration changes.</li>

        <li>Indexer: Added okular notes and gnumeric filters.</li>

        
        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
            <li>Indexing configuration: deleting one customized
              directory would sometimes delete the whole list (depending
              on Qt version I think).</li>
            <li>Indexing configuration: adding a customized directory
              would not make it the active/current one (so that
              another click was needed to choose it before making
              modifications).</li>
            <li>The GUI preview now performs an up to date check
              before displaying data from a subdocument, and proposes
              to reindex the container if it changed. This is mostly
              useful for mailbox containers, where preview would
              sometimes display the wrong message (if the folder had
              been compacted).</li>
            <li>Fix a bug in html charset detection. The wrong charset
              was sometimes used for GUI preview.</li>
            <li>The chm filter can now process files lacking a Topics
              node.</li>
            <li>The default slack for proximity searches from the query
            language (ie: "word1 word2"p) had become 0. It was restored to
            10.</li>
            
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
