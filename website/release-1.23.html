      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.23.x</h1>
      
      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.19-21 </p>

      <p>Some of the input handlers were converted from shell scripts
        to Python programs, and some helper dependancies changed. For
        example, you will need to install python-libxml2 and
        python-libxslt1 in most cases (for replacing xsltproc).</p>

      <p>1.20-23 indexes are fully compatible. Installing 1.23
        over an 1.19 index is possible, but there have been small
        changes in the way compound words (e.g. email addresses) are
        indexed, so it will be best to reset the index. Still, in a
        pinch, 1.23 search can mostly use an 1.19 index. </p>

      <p>Always reset the index if you do not know by which version it
        was created (e.g.: you're not sure it's at least 1.18). The
        best method is to quit all Recoll programs and delete the
        index directory (<span class="literal">
          rm -rf ~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then start <code>recoll</code>
        or <code>recollindex</code>. <br> 

        <span class="literal">recollindex -z</span> will do the same
        in most, but not all, cases. It's better to use
        the <tt>rm</tt> method, which will also ensure that no debris
        from older releases remain (e.g.: old stemming files which are
        not used any more).</p>

      <p>Case/diacritics sensitivity is off by default. It can be
        turned on <em>only</em> by editing
        recoll.conf (
        <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
          see the manual</a>). If you do so, you must then reset the
        index.</p>

      <h2>Minor releases at a glance</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>1.23.2:
          <ul>
            <li>Mostly released because of a couple of
              <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_23_1">bug fixes</a>.</li>
            <li>Updated rclpdf.py handler with improved metadata
              capability (will be documented shortly).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>1.23.1:
          <ul>
            <li>Fixes for the KDE KIO slave build only.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      

      <h2>Changes in Recoll 1.23.0</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.23 has few user-visible changes. The release was
        created mostly because some of the minor feature changes are
        critical from some niche Recoll uses (e.g.: the improved audio
        file properties indexing), and because the changes to the
        logging system were too extensive for a minor version.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Input handler for ODF flat XML file formats.</li>
        
        <li>Configuration: some list configuration variables,
          namely <tt>skippedNames</tt>, <tt>noContentSuffixes</tt>,
          and <tt>xallexcepts</tt>, have acquired variants suffixed
          with <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> for adding or removing
          values from the default value, which is a longish list,
          which hence does not need to be copied for modification any
          more.</li> 

        <li>New <tt>nomd5types</tt> variable for listing types of
          files for which we should not compute an MD5 hash (used for
          duplicates detection). See the manual for details. The
          default list excludes the audio file types.</li>

        <li>Unicode BOM detection for text files</li>

        <li>Allow using full CSS style for term highlighting, not just
          color.</li>

        <li>Internal only: the code now uses some C++11 features
          (e.g. std::threads, std::mutex) to replace home-grown
          hacks. In consequence, a C++11 compiler is now required for
          building. Also C++ streams are used for logging.</li>

        <li><em>execm</em> input handlers now have an alternate method
          to set metadata fields, easier than HTML meta fields.</li>
      </ul>
