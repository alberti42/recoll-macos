# Indexer for "SingleFileZ" files. These are single-file web archives stored in a file with a
# .zip.html extension, which manages to be both sort of an html and sort of a zip
# file. Unfortunately the Python zip interface does not like the hack so that we have to use an
# unzip or 7z command to extract the index.html member.
