/**
 * A data cache implemented as a circularly managed file.
 *
 * A single file is used to serially store objects. The file grows to a specified maximum size, then
 * is rewritten from the start, overwriting older entries.
 *
 * The file begins with a descriptive block, containing both static attributes (e.g. maximum storage
 * size, store duplicate entries or not), and state information (e.g. position of the write pointer
 * for the next entry).
 *
 * The objects inside the cache each have two consecutive parts: an attribute (metadata) dictionary
 * and a data segment. They are named using an externally chosen unique identifier set when storing
 * them. Recoll uses the document UDI for this purpose.
 *
 * The unique identifiers are stored inside the entry's dictionary under the key "udi".
 *
 * It is assumed that the dictionaries are small (they are routinely read/parsed)
