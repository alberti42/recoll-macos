Hello.

This is Recoll, a personal full text indexing system.

Recoll is copyrighted, licensed under a GPL license, see COPYING

Recoll is still in infancy, but it is based on a very strong backend, and
it can actually be useful right now, which is why I release it so early.

It will become much better in the near future.

What it has:

 - Easy installation. No db, web server or exotic language necessary. 
   The idea is that EVERYBODY should index their files because it
   makes life easier.
 - Indexes text, pdf, html, postscript. Deals with compressed versions of
   same. 
 - Support for multiple charsets. Internal processing and storage uses
   Unicode UTF-8.
 - An ugly GUI, qt-based, written with qt Designer.
 - An indexer which runs either as a thread inside the GUI or as an
   external, cron'able program.

What it doesn't have, but will have in the not too far future:

 - A more sophisticated query interface: the current one only does
   probabilistic OR'ed terms. Not even phrases, no stemming (searching for
   a plural won't find the singular). This is very high on the priority
   list, and will come soon because I just have to steal code from xapian
   omega. 
 - A pretty GUI (see above)
 - Mail folder indexing. This would be quite easy to add for single message
   folders right now, more complicated for concatenated ones, I intend to
   do it.
 - An interactive configuration tool. You need to edit files by hand for now.
 - Packages, rpm or other. It' all tar files currently.
 - Documentation and help. 
 - A build system, autoconf et al.
 - etc. etc.

USING:

 - Enter search terms, click <Search> or type <CR>
 - A result list should appear in the left pane. You can use the Next/Prev
   buttons to paginate.
 - Clicking on an entry in the list will display a preview in the right
   pane -- This can take some time for big postscript or pdf files, as the
   file is converted on the fly for preview --
 - Double-clicking on an entry should launch an external viewer, as
   specified in the mimeconf file (see INSTALL). This doesn't work for
   compressed files for now.
 - Use File->Index to rebuild the database.

I very much welcome suggestions or (gasp) code:

Cheers,

INSTALLATION
See the INSTALL file.


CREDITS:

Recoll is mainly a little glue code, and most of the intelligent work uses
code from external projects (xapian, estraier, unac, iconv). 

Recoll borrows (steals?) heavily from the following projects. I tried to
include the relevant copyright attributions with the code. Any omission
is unintentional and will be fixed as soon as notified.

 - Xapian (http://www.xapian.org). The database module (core) is used
   unmodified, and quite a lot of code has been borrowed from Omega, the
   web-based search application (ie: the html parser, plus miscellaneous
   bits and ideas).
 - Estraier (http://estraier.sourceforge.net/). Miscellaneous bits of codes
   and ideas, especially for charset handling, and code from external
   filters.
 - Unac (http://www.senga.org/) for accent removal. This is a relatively small
   package, not that easy to find, it has been integrated almost unmodified
   in the Recoll package.
 - Iconv (http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/), for character set
   conversion.
