Recoll

  Introduction

   This is Recoll, a personal full text indexing system.

   Recoll is free and copyrighted under the GPL license, see COPYING inside
   the distribution. A lot of the code is imported from other packages, see
   the Credits.

   Recoll is still in infancy, but it is based on a very strong backend
   (Xapian), and it can actually be useful right now, which is why I release
   it so early.

   See INSTALL inside the distribution for compiling and installing, very
   much by hand for now, I hope it will become better in the near future.

  Features:

     * Easy installation. No database daemon, web server or exotic language
       necessary. The idea is that EVERYBODY should index their files because
       it makes life easier.
     * Indexes text, pdf, html, postscript. Deals with compressed versions of
       same.
     * Support for multiple charsets. Internal processing and storage uses
       Unicode UTF-8.
     * An ugly GUI, qt-based, written with qt Designer.
     * An indexer which runs either as a thread inside the GUI or as an
       external, cron'able program.

  Things lacking, coming in the not too far future:

     * A more sophisticated query interface: the current one has no boolean
       capabilities, and performance problems with stemming.
     * A pretty GUI (see above)
     * Mail folder indexing. It would be quite easy to add for single message
       folders right now, more complicated for concatenated ones, I intend to
       do it.
     * An interactive configuration tool. You need to edit files by hand for
       now.
     * Packages, rpm or other. It's all tar files currently.
     * A build system, autoconf et al.
     * Documentation and help.
     * More filters for other file types (MS, openoffice), this is coming
       too, this is not hard as it will rely on external packages like the
       existing filters.

  Using recoll

     * Use File->Index to build/rebuild the database.
     * Enter search terms in the upper left text field. There is no query
       language right now, the search only understand probabilistic terms
       (just words...), and double-quote enclosed phrases. Click Search or
       type CR
     * A result list should appear in the left pane. You can use the
       Next/Prev buttons to paginate.
     * Clicking on an entry in the list will display a preview in the right
       pane -- This can take some time for big postscript or pdf files, as
       the file is converted on the fly for preview --
     * Double-clicking on an entry should launch an external viewer, as
       specified in the mimeconf file (see INSTALL). This doesn't work for
       compressed files for now.

   I very much welcome suggestions or (gasp) code

   In hope that this can be useful to somebody, it already is for me.

  Credits

   Recoll is mainly a little glue code, and most of the intelligent work uses
   code from external projects (xapian, estraier, unac, iconv).

   Recoll borrows (steals?) heavily from the following projects. I tried to
   include the relevant copyright attributions with the code. Any omission is
   unintentional and will be fixed as soon as notified.

     * Xapian: The database module (core) is used unmodified, and quite a lot
       of code has been borrowed from Omega, the web-based search application
       (ie: the html parser, plus miscellaneous bits and ideas).
     * Estraier: Miscellaneous bits of codes and ideas, especially for
       charset handling, and code from external filters.
     * Unac: for accent removal. This is a relatively small package, not that
       easy to find, it has been integrated almost unmodified in the Recoll
       package.
     * Iconv, for character set conversion.
