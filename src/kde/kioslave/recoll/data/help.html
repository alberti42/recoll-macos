  <h3>Recoll kio slave</h3>

  <p>Use this module to perform Recoll searches from any program with
    a KIO interface (sort of...). <b>kio_recoll</b> is primarily
    designed and tested with <b>konqueror</b>, and you will
    undoubtedly get even more surprising effects with other tools.</p>

  <p>The module can work in two different modes, depending on the form
    of the URLS that it is given:</p>
    <li><b>Html interface</b>: this is what you get into when you just type
      recoll: or recoll:/ in the address bar, and then click the initial
      icon.</li>
    <li><b>File/Directory interface</b>: which you enter when you pass
      an URL ending with a '/'</li>

  <p>Please note that this module is still in its infancy and that it
    is still more a toy than anything else. The semantics of the
    KIO slaves interface is still a bit unstable between KDE releases, 
    you will certainly get surprising effects from time to time.</p>

  <h4>HTML interface</h4>

  <p>This works more or less like the Recoll QT GUI, much
    simplified. The 
    <a href="http://www.recoll.org/usermanual/rcl.search.lang.html">
      Recoll manual</a> describes the queries that can be
    performed.</p> 
  <p>Most pages in the interface should quite self-explanatory.</p>

  <h4>File interface</h4>

  <p>kio_recoll enters this mode when it receives an URL ending with 
    a&nbsp;'/', ie:</p>
  <blockquote><i>recoll:///xapian recoll ext:.html/</i></blockquote>

  <p>The <i>path</i> part of the URI is taken as a Recoll query
    language string and executed. The results are displayed as
    directory entries.</p>

  <p>This works fine with normal documents, very badly with message
    inside folders, which Konqueror has no way to access.</p>

  <p>As there is no provision to page directory listings, the number
    of results returned is limited to a fixed value, 100 by default,
    which you can change by setting the kio_max_direntries in your
    Recoll configuration file (usually ~/.recoll).

      More information about Recoll configuration.</a></p>

  <p>This interface is very limited, but allows performing multiple
    selection, copies, and other file operations on the results, which
    may be useful in some cases (or not :))</p>
