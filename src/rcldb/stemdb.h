/** Stem database code
 * 
 * Stem databases are key-data stores where the keys are the word stems and the data records are the
 * sets of index terms they expand to.
 *
 * Stem databases are stored as prefixed subtrees inside the Xapian synonyms table (other segments
 * in the table are used for separate term expansions, e.g. accenting and case). See synfamily.h
 *
 * It would probably be possible to store the expansions in the document term list instead (using a
 * prefix to distinguish the stem term). I tried this (chert, 08-2012) and the stem db creation is
 * very slightly slower than with the record approach, and the result is 50% bigger.
 *
 * For future reference, I also tried to store the map in a gdbm file and the result is bigger and
 * takes more time to create than the Xapian version.
 *
 * Stem databases are generated at the end of an indexing session by walking the whole index term
 * list, computing the stem for each term, and building a stem->terms map.
 *
 * Another possible approach would be to update the stem map as we index.  This would probably be be
 * less efficient for a full index pass because each term would be seen and stemmed many times, but
 * it might be more efficient for an incremental pass with a limited number of updated
 * documents. For a small update, the stem building part often dominates the indexing time.
 *
