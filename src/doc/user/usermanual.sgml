      <title>Giving it a try</title>

      <para>If you do not like reading manuals (who does?) and would
      like to give &RCL; a try, just perform <link
      linkend="rcl.install.binary">installation</link> and start the
      <command>recoll</command> user interface, which will index your
      home directory by default, allowing you to search immediately after
      indexing completes.</para>

      <para>Do not do this if your home directory contains a huge
      number of documents and you do not want to wait or are very
      short on disk space. In this case, you may want to edit the <link
      linkend="rcl.indexing.config">configuration file</link> first to
      restrict the indexed area.</para>

      <para>Also be aware that you may need to install the
      appropriate <link linkend="rcl.install.external">
      supporting applications</link> for document types that need
      them (for example <application>antiword</application> for
      ms-word files).</para>
      
    <sect1 id="rcl.introduction.search"> 
      <title>Full text search</title>

      <para>&RCL; is a full text search application. Full text search
        applications let you find your data by content rather
        than by external attributes (like a file name). More
        specifically, they will let you specify words (terms) that
        should or should not appear in the text you are looking for,
        and return a list of matching documents, ordered so that the
        most <emphasis>relevant</emphasis> documents will appear
        first.</para>

      <para>You do not need to remember in what file or email message you
        stored a given piece of information. You just ask for related
        terms, and the tool will return a list of documents where
        those terms are prominent, in a similar way to Internet search
        engines.</para>

      <para>&RCL; tries to determine which documents are most relevant to
      the search terms you provide. Computer algorithms for determining
      relevance can be very complex, and in general are inferior to the
      power of the human mind to rapidly determine relevance. The quality
      of relevance guessing by the search tool is probably the most
      important element for a search application.</para>

      <para>In many cases, you are looking for all the forms of a
        word, not for a specific form or spelling. These different
        forms may include plurals, different tenses for a verb, or
        terms derived from the same root or <emphasis>stem</emphasis>
        (example: floor, floors, floored, flooring...). &RCL; will by
        default expand queries to all such related terms (words that
        reduce to the same stem). This expansion can be disabled at
        search time.</para>

     <para>Stemming, by itself, does not accommodate for misspellings or
        phonetic searches. &RCL; supports these features through a specific
        tool (the <literal>term explorer</literal>) which will let you
        explore the set of index terms along different modes.</para>

      <sect1 id="rcl.introduction.recoll">
      <title>Recoll overview</title>

      <para>&RCL; uses the 
      <ulink url="http://www.xapian.org">&XAP;</ulink> information retrieval
      library as its storage and retrieval engine. &XAP; is a very
      mature package using <ulink
      url="http://www.xapian.org/docs/intro_ir.html">a sophisticated
      probabilistic ranking model</ulink>. &RCL; provides the interface
      to get data into (indexing) and out (searching) of the system.</para>

      <para>In practice, &XAP; works by remembering where terms appear
      in your document files. The acquisition process is called
      indexing. </para> 

      <para>The resulting index can be big (roughly the size of the
        original document set), but it is not a document
        archive. &RCL; can only display documents that still exist at
        the place from which they were indexed. (Actually, there is a
        way to reconstruct a document from the information in the
        index, but the result is not nice, as all formatting,
        punctuation and capitalization are lost).</para>

      <para>&RCL; stores all internal data in <application>Unicode
      UTF-8</application> format, and it can index files with
      different character sets, encodings, and languages into the same
      index. It has input filters for many document types.</para>
      
      <para>Stemming depends on the document language. &RCL; stores
      the unstemmed versions of terms and uses auxiliary databases for
      term expansion. It can switch stemming languages, or add a
      language, without re-indexing.  Storing documents in different
      languages in the same index is possible, and useful in
      practice, but does introduce possibilities of confusion. &RCL;
      currently makes no attempt at automatic language recognition.</para>

      <para>&RCL; has many parameters which define exactly what to
        index, and how to classify and decode the source
        documents. These are kept in a <link
        linkend="rcl.indexing.config">configuration file</link>. A
        default configuration is copied into a standard location
        (usually something like
        <filename>/usr/[local/]share/recoll/examples</filename>)
        during installation. The default parameters from this file may
        be overridden by values that you set inside your personal
        configuration, found by default in the
        <filename>.recoll</filename> sub-directory of your home
        directory. The default configuration will index your home
        directory with default parameters and should be sufficient for
        giving &RCL; a try, but you may want to adjust it
        later.</para>

      <para><link linkend="rcl.indexing.periodic.exec">Indexing</link>
      is started automatically the first time you execute the
      <command>recoll</command> search graphical user interface, or by

    <title>Indexing</title>

    <sect1 id="rcl.indexing.introduction">
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Indexing is the process by which the set of documents is
      analyzed and the data entered into the database. &RCL; indexing
      is normally incremental: documents will only be processed if
      they have been modified. On the first execution, of course, all
      documents will need processing. A full index build can be forced
      later by specifying an option to the indexing command
      (<command>recollindex -z</command>).</para> 

      <para>&RCL; indexing can be performed with two different
       methods:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

	<listitem>
	  <formalpara><title>Periodic indexing:</title>
	    <para>indexing takes place at discrete
	times, by executing the <command>recollindex</command>
	command. The typical usage is to have a nightly indexing run 
      <link linkend="rcl.indexing.periodic.automat">programmed</link> into your
      <command>cron</command> file.</para>
	  </formalpara>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <formalpara><title>Real time indexing:</title>
	    <para>indexing takes place as soon as a file is created or
	    changed. <command>recollindex</command> runs as a daemon
	    and uses a file system alteration monitor such as
	    <application>Fam</application>, 
	    <application>Gamin</application> or
	    <application>inotify</application> do detect file changes.
            Monitoring a big directory tree can consume significant
            system resources.</para>
	  </formalpara>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The choice between the two methods is mostly a matter of
      preference, and they can be combined by setting up multiple
      indexes (ie: use periodic indexing on a big documentation
      directory, and real time indexing on a small home
      directory). Monitoring a big file system tree can consume
      significant system resources, for dubious gains. <para>

      <para>&RCL; knows about quite a few different document
      types. The parameters for document types recognition and
      processing are set in 
       <link linkend="rcl.indexing.config">configuration files</link>
      Most file types, like HTML or word processing files, only hold
      one document. Some file types, like mail folder files can hold
      many individually indexed documents.
      </para>

      <para>&RCL; indexing processes plain text, HTML, openoffice
      and e-mail files internally. Other types (ie: postscript, pdf,
      ms-word, rtf) need external applications for preprocessing. The
      list is in the <link linkend="rcl.install.external">
      installation</link> section.</para>

      <para>Without further configuration, &RCL; will index all
      appropriate files from your home directory, with a reasonable
      set of defaults.</para>

      <para>In some cases, it may be interesting to index different
      areas of the file system to separate databases. You can do this
      by using multiple configuration directories, each indexing a
      file system area to a specific database. See the <link
      linkend="rcl.search.multidb">section about using multiple
      databases</link> for more information on multiple configurations
      and indexes. </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="rcl.indexing.storage">
      <title>Index storage</title>

      <para>The default location for the index data is the
      <filename>xapiandb</filename> subdirectory of the &RCL;
      configuration directory, typically
      <filename>$HOME/.recoll/xapiandb/</filename>. This can be
      changed via two different methods (with different purposes):</para>

      <itemizedlist>

	  <listitem><para>You can specify a different configuration
	  directory by setting the <literal>RECOLL_CONFDIR</literal>
          environment variable, or using the <literal>-c</literal>
          option to the &RCL; commands. This method would typically be
          used to index different areas of the file system to
          different indexes. For example, if you were to issue the
          following commands: 
          <programlisting>
export RECOLL_CONFDIR=~/.indexes-email
recoll
          </programlisting> Then &RCL; would use configuration files
          stored in <filename>~/.indexes-email/</filename> and,
          (unless specified otherwise in
          <filename>recoll.conf</filename>) would look for 
          the index in <filename>~/.indexes-email/xapiandb/</filename>.

          <para>Using multiple configuration directories and 
          <link linkend="rcl.install.config.recollconf">configuration
          options</link> allows you to tailor multiple configurations
          and indexes to handle whatever subset of the available data
          that you wish to make searchable.</para>

	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para>You can also specify a different storage
	  location for the index by setting the <literal>dbdir</literal>
	  parameter in the configuration file 
          (see the <link linkend="rcl.install.config.recollconf">configuration
          section</link>). This method would mainly be of use if you
          wanted to keep the configuration directory in its default location,
          but desired another location for the index, typically out of
          disk occupation concerns.</para>
	  </listitem>

	</itemizedlist>

      <para>The size of the index is determined by the size of the set
      of documents, but the ratio can vary a lot. For a typical mixed
      set of documents, the index size will often be close to
      the data set size. In specific cases (a set of compressed
      mbox files for example), the index can become much bigger than
      the documents. It may also be much smaller if the documents
      contain a lot of images or other non-indexed data (an extreme
      example being a set of mp3 files where only the tags would be
      indexed).</para>

      <para>Of course, images, sound and video do not increase the
      index size, which means that it will be quite typical nowadays
      (2006), that even a big index will be negligible against the
      total amount of data on the computer.</para>
      
      <para>The index data directory (<filename>xapiandb</filename>)
      only contains data that can be completely rebuilt by an index
      run, and it can always be destroyed safely.</para>

      <sect2 id="rcl.indexing.storage.format">
	<title>Xapian index formats</title>

	<para>If your first installation of &RCL; was 1.9.0 or more
	recent, you can skip this section.</para>

	<para>&XAP; has had two possible index formats for quite some
	time. The "old" one named <literal>Quartz</literal>, and the
	new one named <literal>Flint</literal>. &XAP; 0.9 used
	<literal>Quartz</literal> by default, but could use
	<literal>Flint</literal> if a specific environment variable
	(<literal>XAPIAN_PREFER_FLINT</literal>) was set. &XAP; 1.0
	still supports <literal>Quartz</literal> but will use
        <literal>Flint</literal> by default for new index
        creations.</para>

	<para>The number of disk accesses performed during indexing
	has been much optimized in the new <literal>Flint</literal>
	engine and you may see indexing times improved by 50% in some
	cases (compared to <literal>Quartz</literal>), typically for
	big indexes where disk accesses dominate the indexing
	time. There is also a more modest improvement of index
	size.</para>

	<para>&XAP; will not convert automatically an existing index
	from the <literal>Quartz</literal> to the
	<literal>Flint</literal> format. If you have an older index
	and want to take advantage of the new format (which can be
	done without setting the environment variable as of &RCL;
	1.8.2 and &XAP; 1.0.0), you will have to explicitely delete
	the old index, then run a normal indexing process.</para>

	<para>Unfortunately, using the <literal>-z</literal> option to
	<command>recollindex</command> is not sufficient to change the
	format, you have to delete all files inside the index
	directory (typically <filename>~/.recoll/xapiandb</filename>)
	before starting indexing.</para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="rcl.indexing.storage.security">
	<title>Security aspects</title>

	<para>The &RCL; index does not hold copies of the indexed
	documents. But it does hold enough data to allow for an almost
	complete reconstruction. If confidential data is indexed,
	access to the database directory should be restricted. </para>

	<para>As of version 1.4, &RCL; will create the configuration
	directory with a mode of 0700 (access by owner only). As the
	index data directory is by default a sub-directory of the
	configuration directory, this should result in appropriate
	protection.</para> 

	<para>If you use another setup, you should think of the kind
	of protection you need for your index, set the directory
	and files access modes appropriately, and also maybe adjust
	the <literal>umask</literal> used during index updates.</para>

    <sect1 id="rcl.indexing.config">
      <title>Indexing configuration</title>

      <para>Variables set inside the 
      <link linkend="rcl.install.config">&RCL; configuration files</link>
      control which areas of the file system are indexed, and how
      files are processed. These variables can be set either by
      editing the text files or using the dialogs in the
      <command>recoll</command> GUI.</para>

      <para>You can also use <link linkend="rcl.search.multidb">multiple 
      indexes</link> defined by separate configurations, typically to 
      separate personal and shared indexes, or to take advantage of
      the organization of your data to improve search precision.</para> 

      <para>The first time you start <command>recoll</command>, you
      will be asked whether or not you would like recoll to build the
      index. If you want to adjust the configuration before indexing,
      just click <guilabel>Cancel</guilabel> at this point. That way,
      recoll will have created a ~/.recoll directory containing empty
      configuration files.</para>

      <para>The configuration is documented inside the <link
      linkend="rcl.install.config">installation chapter</link> of this
      document, or in the recoll.conf(5) man page, but the most
      current information will most likely be the comments inside the
      sample file. The most immediately useful variable you may
      interested in is probably <link
      linkend="rcl.install.config.recollconf.topdirs">topdirs</link>,
      which determines what subtrees get indexed.</para>

      <para>The applications needed to index file types other than
      text, HTML or email (ie: pdf, postscript, ms-word...) are
      described in the <link linkend="rcl.install.external">external

	<title>The indexing configuration GUI</title>

	<para>As of &RCL; 1.10, most parameters

	<command>recoll</command> GUI running on this configuration
	(either as default, or by setting <literal>RECOLL_CONFDIR</literal>
          or the <literal>-c</literal> option.)</para>

	<para>The interface is started from the
	<guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> menu. It has two main
	panels. The first panel allows setting global variables, like
	the list of top directories or the list of skipped paths. The
	second panel allows setting variables that can be redefined
	for subdirectories. This second panel has an initially empty list of
	customisation directories, to which you can add. The variables
	are then set for the currently selected directory (or at the top
	level if the empty line is selected).</para>

	<para>The meaning for most entries in the interface is 
	self-evident and documented by a <literal>ToolTip</literal>
	popup on the text label. For more detail, you will need to
	refer to the <link linkend="rcl.install.config">configuration
	section</link> of this guide.</para>

	<para>The configuration tool normally respects the comments
	and most of the formatting inside the configuration file, so
	that it is quite possible to use it on hand-edited files,
	which you might nevertheless want to backup first...</para>

      <literal>daemloglevel</literal> configuration parameters). You
      may want to change this. Also the log file will only be truncated
      when the daemon starts. If the daemon runs permanently, the log
      file may grow quite big, depending on the log level.</para>

      <para>While it is convenient that data is indexed in real time,
      repeated indexing can generate a significant load on the system
      when files such as email folders change. You probably do not
      want to enable it if your system is short on resources. Periodic
      indexing is adequate in most cases.</para>

    <title>Searching</title>

    <para>The <command>recoll</command> program provides the user
    interface for searching. It is based on the
    <application>QT</application> library.</para>

    <para><command>recoll</command> has two search modes:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Simple search (the default, on the main screen) has
	a single entry field where you can enter multiple words.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>Advanced search (a panel accessed through the
	<guilabel>Tools</guilabel> menu or the toolbox bar icon) shas
	multiple entry fields, which you may use to build a logical
	condition, with additional filtering on file type and location
	in the file system.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>In most cases, you can enter the terms as you
	think them, even if they contain embedded punctuation or other
	non-textual characters. For
	exemple, &RCL; can handle things like e-mail addresses, or
	arbitrary cut and paste from another text window, punctation
	and all.</para>

    <para>The main case where you should enter text differently from
      how it is printed is for east-oriental languages written with
      Chinese characters. Words composed of single or multiple
      characters should be entered separated by white space in this
      case (they would typically be printed without white
      space).</para>

    <sect1 id="rcl.search.simple">
      <title>Simple search</title>

      <procedure>
	<step><para>Start the <command>recoll</command> program.</para>

	</step>
      </procedure>

      <para>The initial default search mode is <guilabel>All
        terms</guilabel>. This will look for documents containing all
        of the search terms (the ones with more terms will get better
        scores). <guilabel>Any term</guilabel> will search for
        documents where at least one of the terms appear. <guilabel>File
        name</guilabel> will specifically look for file names.</para>

      <para>The fourth entry (<guilabel>Query Language</guilabel>) is
      described in <link linkend="rcl.search.lang">its own
      section</link>.</para> 

      <para>All search modes allow wildcards inside terms
        (<literal>*</literal>, <literal>?</literal>,
        <literal>[]</literal>). You may want to have a look at the
        <link linkend="rcl.search.wildcards">section about wildcards</link>
        for more information about this.</para>

      <para>You can search for exact phrases (adjacent words in a
      given order) by enclosing the input inside double quotes. Ex:
     <literal>"virtual reality"</literal>.</para>

      <para>Character case has no influence on search, except that you
      can disable stem expansion for any term by capitalizing it. Ie:
      a search for <literal>floor</literal> will also normally look for 
      <literal>flooring</literal>, <literal>floored</literal>, etc., but
      a search for <literal>Floor</literal> will only look for
      <literal>floor</literal>, in any character case (stemming can
      also be disabled globally in the preferences). </para>

      <para>&RCL; remembers the last few searches that you
        performed. You can use the simple search text entry widget (a
        combobox) to recall them (click on the thing at the right of the
        text field). Please note, however, that only the search texts
        are remembered, not the mode (all/any/file name).</para>

      <para>Typing <keycap>Esc</keycap> <keycap>Space</keycap> while
        entering a word in the simple search entry will open a window
        with possible completions for the word. The completions are
        extracted from the database.</para>

      <para>Double-clicking on a word in the result list or a preview
      window will insert it into the simple search entry field.</para>

      <para>Note that, apart from wildcard characters (single
      <literal>?</literal> characters are ok), you can cut and paste
      any text into an <guilabel>All terms</guilabel> or
      <guilabel>Any term</guilabel> search field, punctuation,
      newlines and all. &RCL; will process it and produce a meaningful
      search. This is what most differentiates this mode from the
      <guilabel>Query Language</guilabel> mode, where you have to care
      about the syntax.</para>

      <para>You can use the <guilabel>Tools</guilabel> / <guilabel>Advanced
        search</guilabel> dialog for more complex searches.</para>

    <sect1 id="rcl.search.reslist">
      <title>The result list</title>

      <para>After starting a search, a list of results will instantly
       be displayed in the main list window.</para> 

      <para>By default, the document list is presented in order of
       relevance (how well the system estimates that the document
       matches the query). You can specify a different ordering by
       using the  <link linkend="rcl.search.sort"><guilabel>Tools</guilabel>
        / <guilabel>Sort parameters</guilabel></link> dialog.</para>

      <para>Clicking on the
       <literal>Preview</literal> link for an entry will open an
       internal preview window for the document. Further
       <literal>Preview</literal> clicks for the same search will open
       tabs in the existing preview window. You can use
       <keycap>Shift</keycap>+Click to force the creation of another
       preview window, which may be useful to view the documents side
       by side. (You can also browse successive results in a single
       preview window by typing
       <keycap>Shift</keycap>+<keycap>ArrowUp/Down</keycap> in the
       window).</para> 

      <para>Clicking the <literal>Edit</literal> link will attempt to 
       start an external viewer. The viewers can be configured through the
       user preferences dialog, or by editing the
       <filename>mimeview</filename> configuration file.</para>

      <para>The <literal>Preview</literal> and <literal>Edit</literal>
       edit links may not be present for all entries, meaning that
       &RCL; has no configured way to preview a given file type (which
       was indexed by name only), or no configured external viewer for
       the file type. This can sometimes be adjusted simply by tweaking
       the <link linkend="rclinstall.config.mimemap">
             <filename>mimemap</filename></link> and  
       <link linkend="rclinstall.config.mimeview">
       <filename>mimeview</filename></link> configuration files (the latter
       can be modified with the user preferences dialog).</para> 

      <para>You can click on the <literal>Query details</literal> link
        at the top of the results page to see the query actually 
        performed, after stem expansion and other processing.</para>

      <para>Double-clicking on any word inside the result list or a
      preview window will insert it into the simple search text.</para>

      <para>The result list is divided into pages (the size of which
       you can change in the preferences). Use the arrow buttons in the
       toolbar or the links at the bottom of the page to browse the
       results.</para>


      <sect2 id="rcl.search.resultlist.menu">
	<title>The result list right-click menu</title>

	<para>Apart from the preview and edit links, you can display a
          pop-up menu by right-clicking over a paragraph in the result
         list. This menu has the following entries:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para><guilabel>Preview</guilabel></para></listitem>

	<para>The <guilabel>Preview</guilabel> and
          <guilabel>Edit</guilabel> entries do the same thing as the 
          corresponding links.</para>

	<para>The <guilabel>Copy File Name</guilabel> and
	<guilabel>Copy Url</guilabel> copy the relevant data to the
	clipboard, for later pasting.</para> 

        <para>The <guilabel>Find similar</guilabel> entry will select
          a number of relevant term from the current document and enter
          them into the simple search field. You can then start a simple
          search, with a good chance of finding documents related to the
         current result.</para>

        <para>The <guilabel>Parent document</guilabel> entry will
          appear for documents which are not actually files but are
          part of, or attached to, a higher level document. This entry
          is mainly useful for email attachments and permits viewing
          the message to which the document is attached. Note that the
          entry will also appear for an email which is part of an mbox
          folder file, but that you can't actually visualize the
          folder (there will be an error dialog if you try). &RCL; is
          unfortunately not yet smart enough to disable the entry in
          this case.</para>

    <sect1 id="rcl.search.preview">
      <title>The preview window</title>

      <para>The preview window opens when you first click a
      <literal>Preview</literal> link inside the result list.</para>

      <para>Subsequent preview requests for a given search open new
      tabs in the existing window (except if you hold the
      <keycap>Shift</keycap> key while clicking which will open a new
      window for side by side viewing).</para>
      
      <para>Starting another search and requesting a preview will
      create a new preview window. The old one stays open until you
      close it.</para>

      <para>You can close a preview tab by typing <keycap>^W</keycap> 
      (<keycap>Ctrl</keycap> + <keycap>W</keycap>) in the
      window. Closing the last tab for a window will also close the
      window.</para> 

      <para>Of course you can also close a preview window by using the
      window manager button in the top of the frame.</para>

      <para>You can display successive or previous documents from the
      result list inside a preview tab by typing
      <keycap>Shift</keycap>+<keycap>Down</keycap> or
      <keycap>Shift</keycap>+<keycap>Up</keycap> (<keycap>Down</keycap>
      and <keycap>Up</keycap> are the arrow keys).</para> 

      <para>The preview tabs have an internal incremental search
      function. You initiate the search either by typing a
      <keycap>/</keycap> (slash) inside the text area or by clicking
      into the <guilabel>Search for:</guilabel> text field and
      entering the search string. You can then use the
      <guilabel>Next</guilabel> and <guilabel>Previous</guilabel>
      buttons to find the next/previous occurrence. You can also type
      <keycap>F3</keycap> inside the text area to get to the next
      occurrence.</para>

      <para>If you have a search string entered and you use ^Up/^Down
      to browse the results, the search is initiated for each successive
      document. If the string is found, the cursor will be positioned
      at the first occurrence of the search string.</para>

    <sect1 id="rcl.search.lang">
      <title>The query language</title>

      <para>The query language processor is activated on the
      simple search entry when the search mode selector is set to
      <guilabel>Query Language</guilabel>.</para>

      <para>Here follows a sample request that we are going to
      explain:</para>
      <programlisting>
          author:"john doe" Beatles OR Lennon Live OR Unplugged -potatoes
      </programlisting>

      <para>This would search for all documents with 
      <replaceable>John Doe</replaceable>
      appearing as a phrase in the author field (exactly what this is
      would depend on the document type, ie: the
      <literal>From:</literal> header, for an email message),
      and containing either <replaceable>beatles</replaceable> or
      <replaceable>lennon</replaceable> and either
      <replaceable>live</replaceable> or
      <replaceable>unplugged</replaceable> but not
      <replaceable>potatoes</replaceable> (in any part of the document).</para>

      <para>All elements in the search entry are normally combined
      with an implicit AND. It is possible to specify that elements be
      OR'ed instead, as in <replaceable>Beatles</replaceable>
      <literal>OR</literal> <replaceable>Lennon</replaceable>. The
      <literal>OR</literal> must be entered literally (capitals), and
      it has priority over the AND associations:
      <replaceable>word1</replaceable>
      <replaceable>word2</replaceable> <literal>OR</literal>
      <replaceable>word3</replaceable> 
      means 
      <replaceable>word1</replaceable> AND 
      (<replaceable>word2</replaceable> <literal>OR</literal>
      <replaceable>word3</replaceable>)
      not 
      (<replaceable>word1</replaceable> AND
      <replaceable>word2</replaceable>) <literal>OR</literal>
      <replaceable>word3</replaceable>. Do not enter explicit
      parenthesis, they are not supported for now.</para>

      <para>An entry preceded by a <literal>-</literal> specifies a
      term that should <emphasis>not</emphasis> appear.</para>

      <para>The first element in the above exemple,
      <literal>author:"john doe"</literal> is a phrase search limited
      to a specific field. Phrase searches are specified as usual by
      enclosing the words in double quotes. The field specification
      appears before the colon (of course this is not limited to
      phrases, <literal>author:Balzac</literal> would be ok
      too). &RCL; currently manages the following fields:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><literal>title</literal>,
	<literal>subject</literal> or <literal>caption</literal> are
	synonyms which specify data to be searched for in the
	document title or subject.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para><literal>author</literal> or
	<literal>from</literal> for searching the documents originators.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para><literal>keyword</literal> for searching the
	document specified keywords (few documents actually have any).</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>As of release 1.9, the filters have the possibility to
      create other fields with arbitrary names. No standard filters
      use this possibility yet.</para>

      <para>There are two other elements which may be specified
      through the field syntax, but are somewhat special:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><literal>ext</literal> for specifying the file
	name extension (Ex: <literal>ext:html</literal>)</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para><literal>dir</literal> for specifying the file
	location (Ex:
	<literal>dir:/home/me/somedir</literal>). Please note
	that this is quite inefficient, that it may produce very
	slow searches, and that it may be worth in some
	cases to set up separate databases instead.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para><literal>mime</literal> for specifying the
	mime type. This one is quite special because you can specify
	several values which will be OR'ed (the normal default for the
	language is AND). Ex: <literal>mime:text/plain
	mime:text/html</literal>. Specifying an explicit boolean
	operator or negation (<literal>-</literal>) before a
	<literal>mime</literal> specification is not supported and
	will produce strange results.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The query language is currently the only way to use the
      &RCL; field search capability.</para>

      <para>Words inside phrases and capitalized words are not
      stem-expanded. Wildcards may be used anywhere inside a term.
      Specifying a wild-card on the left of a term can produce a very
      slow search.</para>

      <para>You can use the <literal>show query</literal> link at the
      top of the result list to check the exact query which was
      finally executed by Xapian.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="rcl.search.complex">
      <title>Complex/advanced search</title>

      <para>The advanced search dialog has a number of fields that
        will allow a more refined search. Each entry field is
        configurable for the following modes:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>All terms.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Any term.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para>None of the terms.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Phrase (exact terms in order within an

	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Proximity (terms in any order within an
	  adjustable window).</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Filename search with wildcards.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

      <para>Additional entry fields can be created by clicking the
      <guilabel>Add clause</guilabel> button.</para>

      <para>You can choose that all relevant fields will be combined
      by either an AND or an OR conjunction. All types of clauses
      except "phrase" and "near" can accept a mix of single words and
      phrases enclosed in double quotes. Stemming expansion will be
      performed for all terms not beginning with a capital letter,
      except for terms inside "phrase" clauses. Wildcards will be
      processed everywhere.</para>

      <para>Advanced search will also let you search for documents of
       specific mime types (ie: only <literal>text/plain</literal>, or
        <literal>text/HTML</literal> or
        <literal>application/pdf</literal> etc...). The state of the
        file type selection can be saved as the default (the file type
        filter will not be activated at program start-up, but the lists
        will be in the restored state).</para>

      <para>You can also restrict the search results
      to a sub-tree of the indexed area. If you need to do this often,
      you may think of setting up multiple indexes instead, as the
      performance will be much better.</para>

      <para>Click on the <guilabel>Start Search</guilabel> button in
      the advanced search dialog, or type <keycap>Enter</keycap> in
      any text field to start the search. The button in
      the main window always performs a simple search.</para>

      <para>Click on the <literal>Show query details</literal> link at
      the top of the result page to see the query expansion.</para>

    <sect1 id="rcl.search.termexplorer">
      <title>The term explorer tool</title>

      <para>&RCL; automatically manages the expansion of search terms
      to their derivatives (ie: plural/singular, verb
      inflections). But there are other cases where the exact search
      term is not known. For example, you may not remember the exact
      spelling, or only know the beginning of the name.</para>

      <para>The term explorer tool (started from the toolbar icon or
      from the <guilabel>Term explorer</guilabel> entry of the
      <guilabel>Tools</guilabel> menu) can be used to search the full index

        <variablelist>

          <varlistentry>
	    <term>Wildcard</term>
            <listitem><para>In this mode of operation, you can enter a
            search string with shell-like wildcards (*, ?, []). ie:
            <replaceable>xapi*</replaceable> would display all index terms
            beginning with <replaceable>xapi</replaceable>. (More

            <replaceable>word[0-9]+</replaceable>. The expression is
            implicitely anchored at the beginning. Ie:
            <replaceable>press</replaceable> will match
            <replaceable>pression</replaceable> but not
            <replaceable>expression</replaceable>. You can use
            <replaceable>.*press</replaceable> to match the latter,
            but be aware that this will cause a full index term list
            scan, which can be quite long.</para>

          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>

	  <term>Stem expansion</term>
	  <listitem><para>This mode will perform the usual stem expansion
	  normally done as part user input processing. As such it is
	  probably mostly useful to demonstrate the process.
	  </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
	    <term>Spelling/Phonetic</term> <listitem><para>In this
            mode, you enter the term as you think it is spelled, and
            &RCL; will do its best to find index terms that sound like
            your entry. This mode uses the
            <application>Aspell</application> spelling application,
            which must be installed on your system for things to work
            (if your documents contain non-ascii characters, &RCL;
            needs an aspell version newer than 0.60 for UTF-8
            support). The language which is used to build the
            dictionary out of the index terms (which is done at the
            end of an indexing pass) is the one defined by your NLS
            environment. Weird things will probably happen if
            languages are mixed up.</para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>Note that in cases where &RCL; does not know the beginning
      of the string to search for (ie a wildcard expression like
      <replaceable>*coll</replaceable>), the expansion can take quite
      a long time because the full index term list will have to be
      processed. The expansion is currently limited at 200 results for
      wildcards and regular expressions.</para>
      
      <para>Double-clicking on a term in the result list will insert
      it into the simple search entry field. You can also cut/paste

    <sect1 id="rcl.search.multidb">
      <title>Multiple databases</title>

      <para>Multiple &RCL; databases or indexes can be created by
      using several configuration directories which are usually set to
      index different areas of the file system. A specific index can
      be selected for updating or searching, using the
      <literal>RECOLL_CONFDIR</literal> environment variable or the
      <literal>-c</literal> option to <command>recoll</command> and
      <command>recollindex</command>.</para>

      <para>A <command>recollindex</command> program instance can only
      update one specific index.</para>

      <para>A <command>recoll</command> program instance is also
      associated with a specific index, which is the one to be
      updated by its indexing thread, but it can use any
      number of &RCL; indexes for searching. The external indexes
      can be selected through the <guilabel>external
      indexes</guilabel> tab in the preferences dialog.</para>

      <para>Index selection is performed in two phases. A set of all
      usable indexes must first be defined, and then the subset of
      indexes to be used for searching. Of course, these parameters
      are retained across program executions (there are kept
      separately for each &RCL; configuration). The set of all indexes
      is usually quite stable, while the active ones might typically
      be adjusted quite frequently.</para>

      <para>The main index (defined by
      <literal>RECOLL_CONFDIR</literal>) is always active. If this is
      undesirable, you can set up your base configuration to index
      an empty directory.</para>

      <para>As building the set of all indexes can be a little tedious
      when done through the user interface, you can use the
      <literal>RECOLL_EXTRA_DBS</literal> environment
      variable to provide an initial set. This might typically be
      set up by a system administrator so that every user does not
      have to do it. The variable should define a colon-separated list
      of index  directories, ie: 
     </para>
       <screen>export RECOLL_EXTRA_DBS=/some/place/xapiandb:/some/other/db</screen> 

      <para>A typical usage scenario for the multiple index feature
      would be for a system administrator to set up a central index
      for shared data, that you choose to search or not in addition to
      your personal data. Of course, there are other
      possibilities. There are many cases where you know the subset of
      files that should be searched, and where narrowing the search
      can improve the results. You can achieve approximately the same
      effect with the directory filter in advanced search, but
      multiple indexes will have much better performance and may be
      worth the trouble.</para>

    <sect1 id="rcl.search.history">
      <title>Document history</title>

      <para>Documents that you actually view (with the internal preview
        or an external tool) are entered into the document history,
        which is remembered.</para> 
      <para>You can display the history list by using
        the <guilabel>Tools/</guilabel><guilabel>Doc History</guilabel> menu

    <sect1 id="rcl.search.sort">
      <title>Sorting search results</title>

      <para>The documents in a result list are normally sorted in
      order of relevance. It is possible to specify different sort
      parameters by using the <guimenu>Sort parameters</guimenu>
      dialog (located in the <guimenu>Tools</guimenu>
      menu).</para>

      <para>The tool sorts a specified number of the most
      relevant documents in the result list, according to
      specified criteria. The currently available criteria are
      <emphasis>date</emphasis> and <emphasis>mime type</emphasis>.</para> 

      <para>The sort parameters stay in effect until they are explicitly
      reset, or the program exits. An activated sort is indicated in
      the result list header.</para>

      <para>Sort parameters are remembered between program
      invocations, but result sorting is normally always inactive when
      the program starts. It is possible to keep the sorting
      activation state between program invocations by checking the
      <guilabel>Remember sort activation state</guilabel>
      option in the preferences.</para>

	<para>Typing <keycap>Esc</keycap> <keycap>Space</keycap> in

	either complete the current word if its beginning matches a
	unique term in the index, or open a window to propose a list
	of completions.</para>

      </formalpara>

      <formalpara><title>Disabling stem expansion</title>
      <para>Entering a capitalized word in any search field will prevent
        stem expansion (no search for
        <literal>gardening</literal> if you enter
        <literal>Garden</literal> instead of
        <literal>garden</literal>). This is the only case where
        character case should make a difference for a &RCL;
        search. You can also disable stem expansion or change the
        stemming language in the preferences.</para>
      </formalpara>

      <formalpara><title>Phrases</title>
      <para>A phrase can be looked for by enclosing it in double
        quotes. Example: <literal>"user manual"</literal> will look
        only for occurrences of <literal>user</literal> immediately
        followed by <literal>manual</literal>. You can use the
        <guilabel>This exact phrase</guilabel> field of the advanced
        search dialog to the same effect. Phrases can be entered along
        simple terms in all simple or advanced search entry fields
        (except <guilabel>This exact phrase</guilabel>).</para>

      <formalpara><title>Browsing the result list inside a preview 
                   window (1.5)</title>
       <para>Entering <keycap>Shift-Down</keycap> or <keycap>Shift-Up</keycap>
       (<keycap>Shift</keycap> + an arrow key) in a preview window will
       display the next or the previous document from the result
       list. Any secondary search currently active will be executed on
       the new document.</para>
      </formalpara>

      <formalpara><title>Forced opening of a preview window (1.6)</title>
       <para>You can use <keycap>Shift</keycap>+Click on a result list

       preview window instead of a new tab in the existing one.</para>
      </formalpara>

      <formalpara><title>AutoPhrases (1.5)</title>
      <para>This option can be set in the preferences dialog. If it is
      set, a phrase will be automatically built and added to simple
      searches when looking for <literal>Any terms</literal>. This
      will not change radically the results, but will give a relevance
      boost to the results where the search terms appear as a
      phrase. Ie: searching for <literal>virtual reality</literal>
      will still find all documents where either
      <literal>virtual</literal> or <literal>reality</literal> or 
      both appear, but those which contain <literal>virtual
      reality</literal> should appear sooner in the list.</para>

      <formalpara><title>Finding related documents</title>
	<para>Selecting the <guilabel>Find similar documents</guilabel> entry
	in the result list paragraph right-click menu will select a
	set of "interesting" terms from the current result, and insert
	them into the simple search entry field. You can then possibly
	edit the list and start a search to find documents which may
	be apparented to the current result.</para>

      <formalpara><title>File names</title>
        <para>File names are added as terms during indexing, and you can
        specify them as ordinary terms in normal search fields (&RCL; used
        to index all directories in the file path as terms. This has been

        can use the specific file name search which will
        <emphasis>only</emphasis> look for file names and can use wildcard
        expansion.</para>

      <title>Configuration overview</title>

      <para>Most of the parameters specific to the
         <command>recoll</command> GUI are set through the
          <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> menu and stored in the
          standard QT place
          (<filename>$HOME/.qt/recollrc</filename>). You probably do not
          want to edit this by hand.</para>

      <para>For other options, &RCL; uses text configuration
        files. You will have to edit them by hand for 
        now (there is still some hope for a GUI configuration tool
        in the future). The most accurate documentation for the
        configuration parameters is given by comments inside the default
        files, and we will just give a general overview here.</para>

      <para>There are two sets of configuration files. The system-wide
      files are kept in a directory named like
      <filename>/usr/[local/]share/recoll/examples</filename>, 
      they define default values for the system. A parallel set of
      files exists by default in the <filename>.recoll</filename> directory
      in your home. This directory can be changed with the 
      <literal>RECOLL_CONFDIR</literal> environment variable or the -c
      option parameter to <command>recoll</command> and
      <command>recollindex</command>.</para> 

      <para>If the <filename>.recoll</filename> directory does not
      exist when <command>recoll</command> or 
        <command>recollindex</command> are started, it will be created
        with a set of empty configuration files.
        <command>recoll</command> will give you a chance to edit the
        configuration file before starting
        indexing. <command>recollindex</command> will proceed
        immediately. To avoid mistakes, the automatic directory
        creation will only occur for the
       default location, not if <literal>-c</literal> or
       <literal>RECOLL_CONFDIR</literal> were used (in the latter
       cases, you will have to create the directory).</para>
      

        <para>All configuration files share the same format. For
        example, a short extract of the main configuration file might
        look as follows:</para> 
        <programlisting>
        # Space-separated list of directories to index.
        topdirs =  ~/docs /usr/share/doc

        [~/somedirectory-with-utf8-txt-files]
        defaultcharset = utf-8
        </programlisting>

        <para>There are three kinds of lines: </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>Comment (starts with
          <emphasis>#</emphasis>) or empty.</para> 
          </listitem>
          <listitem><para>Parameter affectation (<emphasis>name =
          value</emphasis>).</para>

          ([<emphasis>somedirname</emphasis>]).</para> 
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Section definitions allow redefining some parameters for
        a directory sub-tree. They stay in effect until another
        section definition, or the end of file, is encountered. Some
        of the parameters used for indexing are looked up
        hierarchically from the current directory location
        upwards. Not all parameters can be meaningfully redefined,
        this is specified for each in the next section. </para>

        <para>When found at the beginning of a file path, the tilde
        character (~) is expanded to the name of the user's home
        directory, as a shell would do.</para> 
        
        <para>White space is used for separation inside  lists.
        List elements with embedded spaces can be quoted using
        double-quotes.</para>

        <title>The mimemap file</title>

        <para><filename>mimemap</filename> specifies the
        file name extension to mime type mappings.</para> 

	<para>For file names without an extension, or with an unknown
        one, the system's <command>file -i</command> command will be
        executed to determine the mime type (this can be switched off
        inside the main configuration file).</para>

        <para>The mappings can be specified on a per-subtree basis,
        which may be useful in some cases. Example:
        <application>gaim</application> logs have a
        <filename>.txt</filename> extension but 
        should be handled specially, which is possible because they
        are usually all located in one place.</para>

        <para><filename>mimemap</filename> also has a
        <literal>recoll_noindex</literal> variable which is a list of
        suffixes. Matching files will be skipped (which avoids
        unnecessary decompressions or <command>file</command>
        executions). This is partially redundant with
        <literal>skippedNames</literal> in the main configuration
        file, with two differences: it will not affect directories,
        and it cannot be made dependant on the file-system location
        (it is a configuration-wide parameter). You could accomplish
        with <literal>skippedNames</literal> anything that
        <literal>recoll_noindex</literal> does. The latter is used
        mostly for things known to be unindexable by a given &RCL;
        version. Having it there avoids cluttering the more
        user-oriented and locally customized

      <sect2 id="rcl.extending.filters">
	<title>Writing a document filter</title>

	<para>&RCL; filters are executable programs which 
	translate from a specific format (ie:
	<application>openoffice</application>,
	<application>acrobat</application>, etc.) to the &RCL;
	indexing input format, which was chosen to be HTML.</para>

	<para>&RCL; filters are usually shell-scripts, but this is in
	no way necessary. These programs are extremely simple and most
	of the difficulty lies in extracting the text from the native
	format, not outputting what is expected by &RCL;. Happily
	enough, most document formats already have translators or text
	extractors which handle the difficult part and can be called
	from the filter.</para>

	<para>Filters are called with a single argument which is the
	source file name. They should output the result to stdout.</para>

	<para>The <literal>RECOLL_FILTER_FORPREVIEW</literal>
	environment variable (values <literal>yes</literal>,
	<literal>no</literal>) tells the filter if the operation is
	for indexing or previewing. Some filters use this to output a
	slightly different format. This is not essential.</para>

	<para>The output HTML could be very minimal like the following
	example:</para>

	<programlisting>&lt;html>&lt;head>
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">
&lt/head>
&lt;body>some text content&lt;/body>&lt;/html>
          </programlisting>

	<para>You should take care to escape some characters inside
	  the text by transforming them into appropriate
	  entities. "<literal>&amp;</literal>" should be transformed into
	  "<literal>&amp;amp;</literal>", "<literal>&lt;</literal>"
	  should be transformed into "<literal>&amp;lt;</literal>".</para>

	<para>The character set needs to be specified in the
	  header. It does not need to be UTF-8 (&RCL; will take care
	  of translating it), but it must be accurate for good
	  results.</para>

	<para>&RCL; will also make use of other header fields if
	  they are present: <literal>title</literal>,
	  <literal>description</literal>,
	  <literal>keywords</literal>.</para>

	<para>As of &RCL; release 1.9, filters also have the
	possibility to "invent" field names. This should be output as
	meta tags:</para>

	<programlisting>
&lt;meta name="somefield" content="Some textual data" /&gt;
</programlisting>
	
	<para>In this case, a correspondance between field name and
	&XAP; prefix should also be added to the
	<filename>mimeconf</filename> file. See the existing entries
	for inspiration. The field can then be used inside the query
	language to narrow searches.</para>

	<para>The easiest way to write a new filter is probably to start
          from an existing one.</para>
