    unity-lens-bliss is is a very simple application launcher lens for
    Unity. Mostly meant to be used as a starting point for users wanting to
    write their own lens or customize this lens to their needs.

unity-lens-recoll uses the starting point and replaces the search part with
recoll queries.

Install with:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc && make && sudo make install

or if you checked the code out from a bazaar branch:

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc  && make && sudo make install
