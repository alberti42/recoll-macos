# This file should be copied to your configuration directory (e.g. ~/.recoll) an possibly edited.
# Unlike the other configuration files, no defaults are obtained from the shared configuration
# directory: only the values from the user configuration are used.

# The Joplin indexer is installed with recoll (filters/rcljoplin.py).
# Because the indexer script is in the "filters" directory, there is no need for absolute paths
