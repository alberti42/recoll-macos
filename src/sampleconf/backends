# This configuration file has a description of the active external indexers. See the manual for more
# detail: Programming interface -> Python API -> Creating Python external indexers
#
# This file should be copied to your configuration directory (e.g. ~/.recoll) and edited

# The Joplin indexer is installed with recoll (filters/rcljoplin.py) but not activated by
# default. Because the indexer script is in the "filters" directory, there is no need for absolute
# paths

#fetch = rcljoplin.py fetch
#makesig = rcljoplin.py makesig
#index = rcljoplin.py index

# The MBOX indexer is useless because it does the same thing as the internal mbox handler, but it is
# an example of external indexer using ipaths. Change the paths to wherever you extracted the source
# code.
