# Each element in the space-separated list has the special character as
# first element and the translation following. The handling of both the
# lowercase and upper-case versions of a character should be specified, as
# appartenance to the list will turn-off both standard accent and case
# processing. Examples: 
# Swedish:
# unac_except_trans =  åå Åå ää Ää öö Öö
# German:
# unac_except_trans = Ää Öö Üü ää öö üü ßss
