# Recoll : associations of mime types to processing filters.
# There are different sections for decompression, 'interning' for indexing
# and preview, and external viewers

## #######################################
# Decompression: these types need a first pass to create a temp file to
# work with. We use a script because uncompress utilities usually work in
# place, which is not suitable. 
#
# The %t parameter will be substituted to the name of a temporary directory
# by recoll. This directory is guaranteed empty when calling the filter
#
# The %f parameter will be substituted with the input file. 
#
# The script (ie: rcluncomp) must output the uncompressed file name on
# stdout. 
application/x-gzip  =  uncompress rcluncomp gunzip %f %t
application/x-compress = uncompress rcluncomp gunzip %f %t
application/x-bzip2 =  uncompress rcluncomp bunzip2 %f %t

## ###################################
# Filters for indexing and internal preview. 
# The "internal" filters are hardwired in the c++ code.
# The external "exec" filters are typically scripts. By default, they output the
# document in simple html format, have a look at the scripts.
# A different format (ie text/plain), and a character set can be defined for
# each filter, see the exemples below (ie: msword)
[index]

# MSWORD: the rcldoc script handles a number of marginal case that raw
# antiword won't:
#  - with wvWare: "text stream of this file is too small to handle" 
#  - with unrtf: rtf files disguising as doc files.
# The default is now again to use rcldoc. Use raw antiword if speed is more
# important for you than catching all data, 
application/msword = exec rcldoc
#application/msword = exec antiword -t -i 1 -m UTF-8;mimetype=text/plain;charset=utf-8
# You can also use wvware directly but it's much slower.
# application/msword = exec wvWare --charset=utf-8 --nographics
