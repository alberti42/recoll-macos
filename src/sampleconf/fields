# Field names configuration. This defines how one may search ie for:
#   author:Hemingway
#
# Important: 
#   - the field names MUST be all lowercase alphabetic ascii here. They can
#     be anycased in the documents.

[prefixes]

#####################################################
# This section defines what prefix the terms inside named fields will be
# indexed with (in addition to prefix-less indexing for general search)
# ALL prefixes MUST be all UPPERCASE. 
# 
# The field names should be the canonic ones, not the aliases defined in
# the following section. Don't change those which are predefined here, 
# quite a few are hard-coded in the c++. But you can add more (for new
# fields emitted by filters).
#
# Fields can have two relevance boost factors defined, such as in:
# caption = S ; wdfinc=10
#  and/or
# caption = S ; boost = 10
# The first line would boost the xapian "within document frequency" of
# caption terms by a factor of 10 at indexing time. The second one 
# (NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED) would automatically boost the weight of a
# caption-based field query (ie: caption:mytitle or title:mytitle) at query
# time.

# The following ones are probably hard-coded in the c code, can't change at
# all.
# Also reserved: F(parentid), Q(uniqueid)
title = S ; wdfinc = 10
author = A
abstract = XS
caption = S
title = S
subject = S
author = A
keywords= K
xapyear = Y
xapyearmon = M
xapdate = D
mtype = T
rclUnsplitFN = XSFS
filename = XSFN
ext = XE

# Extension examples. These are actually used by default by Recoll, you can
# add your own to search for fields produced by the filters and not handled
# by default. 
# Some values are internally reserved by recoll: 
#   XE (file ext), XP (for path elements), XSFN, XSFS, XXST, XXND, XXPG
# Using XX was not a good idea. 
#
# I hereby commit to not using XY for Recoll:
# *** USE XY for beginning your local prefixes *** ie:
# myfield = XYMYPREF
recipient = XTO

[stored]
############################
# Some fields are stored in the document data record inside the index and
# can be returned in result lists. There is no necessity that stored fields
# should be indexed (have a prefix in the preceding section) (example:
# "url", but this one doesn't need to be listed here, it's stored by hard
# code)
#
# Some fields are stored by default, don't add them here:
#    caption, keywords, abstract, mimetype, url
# Only canonical names should be used here, not aliases.
# "author" used to be stored by default, now set here as optional
# "rclaptg" is used for viewer specialization (depending on local config)
# "rclbes" defines the backend type (ie normal fs, firefox cache). Should
#   probably be hardcoded, don't remove it

[aliases]
##########################
# This section defines field names aliases or synonyms. Any right hand side
# value will be turned into the lhs canonic name before further treatment
#
# The left-hand values in the recoll distribution file are well known and
# must match names used in the c++ code, or even the index data
# record. They can't change! But you can add others.
#
# Filters should only add canonic names to the meta array when indexing,
# not aliases.

[xattrtofields]
######################
# Section to define translations from extended file attribute names to
# field names. xattr use must be enabled at compile time for this to be
# used. Enter translations as "xattrname = fieldname". Case matters.

# Sections reserved for specific filters follow
#

##########################
# Mail filter section. You can specify mail headers to be indexed 
# in addition to the standard ones: (To:, Cc:, From:, Subject:, Date, 
# Message-Id), along with the field name to be used. For this to be useful, 
# the field name should also be listed in the [prefixes] and possibly the
# [stored] sections.
