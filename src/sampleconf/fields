# Field names configuration. This defines how one may search ie for 
#   author:Hemingway
#
# Important: 
#   - the field names MUST be all lowercase alphabetic ascii here. They can
#     be anycased in the documents.

#####################################################
# This section defines what prefix the terms inside named fields will be
# indexed with (in addition to prefix-less indexing for general search)
# ALL prefixes MUST be all UPPERCASE. Extension prefixes begin with X 
# 
# The choice of field names is rather arbitrary. Use of any of the aliases
# defined in the following section will yield exactly the same results,
# (both for indexing and search).
[prefixes]

# Native fields matching omega uses, which we index without an X first
# letter. Don't change these. Caption is used for 'title' to keep a last
# remnant of omega compatibility inside the data record
caption = S
author = A
keywords = K

# Extension examples. These are actually used by default by Recoll, you can
# add your own to search for fields produced by the filters and not handled
# by default.

############################
# Some fields are stored in the document data record inside the index and
# can be returned in result lists. There is no necessity that stored fields
# should be indexed (have a prefix in the preceding section) (example:
# "url", but this one doesn't need to be listed here, it's stored by hard
# code)
#
# Some fields are stored by default, don't add them here, else they will be
# stored twice: caption, keywords, abstract, filename, mimetype, url
# Only canonical names should be used here, not aliases.
# "author" used to be stored by default, now set here as optional
# "rclaptg" is used for viewer specialization (depending on local config)

# This section defines field names aliases or synonyms. Any right hand side
# value will be turned into the lhs canonic name before further treatment
#
# The left-hand values in the recoll distribution file are well known and
# must match names used in the c++ code, or even the index data
# record. They can't change! But you can add others.
#
# Filters should only add canonic names to the meta array when indexing,
# not aliases.

# in addition to the standard ones: (To:, Cc:, From:, Subject:, Date,
