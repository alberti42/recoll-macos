# Recoll

Recoll is a desktop full-text search tool. It finds keywords inside
documents as well as file names. 

* Versions are available for Linux and MS Windows.
* A WEB front-end with preview and download features can replace or
  supplement the GUI for remote use. 
* It can search most document formats. You may need external applications
  for text extraction. 
* It can reach any storage place: files, archive members, email
  attachments, transparently handling decompression. 
* One click will open the document inside a native editor or display an
  even quicker text preview. 
* The software is free, open source, and licensed under the GPL.
