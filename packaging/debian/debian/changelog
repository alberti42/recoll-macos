  * Allow using multiple temporary Xapian indexes and a final merge.
    This is useful for cases where the single-threaded Xapian index
    updates would be the indexing speed bottleneck, which would typically
    happen with simple input like HTML files. In such a case it can bring a
    huge speedup of indexing, e.g. 3X on a 4 Core CPU.

    with webengine).

    more because of internally using absolute URLs.

  * Display previews using the main HTML engine (webkit or webengine)
    instead of a QTextBrowser. Improves highlighting search terms while
    walking them with the Prev/Next buttons.

recoll (1.36.0-1~ppaPPAVERS~SERIES1) SERIES; urgency=low

  * It is now possible to run external/foreign indexers on a single
    index, with support for targeted purges (purges had been the
    reason why this was not really feasible previously).  See
    https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/webhelp/docs/RCL.PROGRAM.PYTHONAPI.UPDATE.html
    for more detail. A sample indexer for indexing a
    'Joplin' notes database is distributed with the 'Recoll'
    installation and described in the above chapter.
  * The parameter names in the main configuration file are now
    independent of character case. This was falsely claimed for an
    earlier release, it should now be true.
  * GUI: hopefully improve the font sizes consistency in the different
    windows and panels.
  * Installing the 'librecoll' library in the standard '$libdir'
    location is now the default. Use the '--disable-publiclib'
    'configure' option if you want to install it to the 'recoll'
    lib sub-directory instead.
  * New index configuration parameter 'idxnoautopurge' to disable the
    deleted files purge pass after updating index. This can be useful
    for configurations on which part of the data set is expected to be
    unavailable at times. Use the '-P' 'recollindex' command line flag
    to force a purge (with all the data present). If the parameter is
    not set, you can also use the '--nopurge' 'recollindex' command
    line flag to skip the purge.

recoll (1.35.0-1~ppaPPAVERS~SERIES1) SERIES; urgency=low

  * Add support for installing the recoll library in the
    standard $libdir location, so that the KDE modules can be built
    outside the source tree and dynamically linked.  This installation
    mode is still not the default and can be enabled with configure
    --enable-publiclib
  * GUI: If the desktop open method is enabled (default), use it even
    for files with MIME types which we do not know anything about
    (these used to not have an 'Open' link in results). 
  * GUI: preview: add menu entries to reload document as plain text or
    HTML: helps viewing some docs which display badly as HTML in dark
    mode because they explicitly specify dark foreground color
    (e.g. some rtf docs).
  * GUI: allow setting up a script to create missing thumbnails (for
    the result list). See the 'thumbnailercmd' configuration
    parameter.
  * GUI: fix the Webengine version copying the icon instead of the
    target document when the icon is dragged from the result list.
  * GUI: avoid listing the original term among the possible spelling
    replacements when no results.
  * Fix bug causing the phrase slack to increase when queries contained multiple phrases.
  * Add optional support for using the 'statx() stx_btime' field
    (birth date) in addition to the modification time for indexing and
    searching. This code was contributed by: Zhijun Li
    <lizj@dingdao.com>, Jianye Shi <shijy@dingdao.com>, Biao Dong
    <dongbiao@dingdao.com> (Ding (Beijing) Intelligent Technology
    Co. Ltd). The function can be enabled by using
    'configure --enable-ext4-birthtime'.
  * Allow using wildcards for specifying MIME types for which we don't
    compute an MD5 (e.g. 'video/*').
  * Audio handler: use consistent '' | '' separator when multiple values are found for a field.
  * Monitoring indexer: fix the 'followlinks' parameter only working
    for the first member of the 'topdirs' list.
  * Fix the memory size limitation for handlers (filtermaxmbytes) not working when set
    over 2 GB.
  * Fix the 'tar' handler to work with actual binary paths.
  * Python: export new method 'db.getDoc(udi)'. Have 'doc.setbinurl()'
    accept 'bytes' in addition to 'bytearray'.

  * Fix jupyter notebook indexing: only the code was extracted.
  * Add config line for text/x-rpm-spec and text/x-copying: COPYING and .spec
    files were not indexed.
  * Packaging: install the needed pyaspell python extension, renamed as
    recollaspell to avoid conflicts. pyaspell is not commonly packaged so we
    can't have a depend. Actually makes it possible to use the automatic
    spelling expansion capability in the packaged version. It is not enabled by
    default, do it from the GUI search preferences.
  * rclaudio: add capability to run OpenAI whisper speech-to-text and index the
    result, which is also cached the same way as  OCR data (immune to index
    resets and file moves). This is off by default and activated by setting
    parameters in recoll.conf, see the manual and
    https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/faqsandhowtos/IndexAudioWhisper.html
  * Add a sample Python external indexer for indexing the Joplin notes
    database. See src/python/samples/rcljoplin.py, which has comments for
    configuration and setup at the top.
  * GUI: add option to show hit counts in completer popup.

  * New 'x' modifier to trigger term expansion in a phrase search. Previously, phrase searches were
    always verbatim, with no way to adjust.
  * New 'stemexpandphrases' configuration  parameter to default to expanding phrase terms.
  * Fix handling or file or directory names with white space at the end: an URL ending with such a
    name would be stripped of the space/tab characters, making it impossible to open the document.
  * Fixed document field aliasing not working if the alias name was not all lower case.
  * GUI: result list: do not display snippets without a highlight area. This could occur before when
    searching for a phrase or group, and the snippet contained the search terms, but not the
    phrase/proximity match.
  * GUI: fixed query processing losing some filtering information (e.g. dates, subspec) in some
    cases. Would esp. interfere with the use of the query fragments tool.
  * GUI: the preview window font was sometimes not adjusted in function of the result list one.
  * GUI: add thunderbird-open-message.sh script to help thunderbird open arbitrary message/rf822
    files, even if their name extension is not '.eml'.
  * GUI: make Ctrl+Q work in the fragments window.
  * PDF: fixed XMP metadata extraction in some case where the XML structure was unexpected.
  * PDF: take advantage of newer poppler pdfinfo versions to extract custom properties
    ('pdfinfo{nbsp}-custom').
  * rclaudio: allow outputting custom, non-standard tags. Better processing of multiple values.
  * Indexer: only update the status file if it actually changed: will avoid a lot of gratuitous disk

   - The use of a separate readonly Database object for querying the index
     while indexing would trigger Xapian errors, (bad block reads), and
     subsequent up-to-date check failures (leading to unnecessary
     reindexing). The jury is out as to the cause, but using the same
     object for reading and writing seems to eliminate the problem.

   - A spurious log message in the child process between forking and
     executing the filter could block on a mutex, and lead to a 20 mn
     timeout for the affected father process thread (happened only in
     multithread mode).
