Description: Recoll KIO slave for KDE 4
 Recoll KIO slave for KDE 4, allows performing a Recoll search by
 entering an appropriate URL in a KDE open dialog, or with an HTML-based
 interface displayed in Konqueror.  
 The HTML-based interface is similar to the Recoll GUI QT-based interface,
 slightly less powerful. It allows performing a search while staying fully
 within the KDE framework: drag and drop from the result list works
 normally and you have your normal choice of applications for opening files. 
 An alternative interface uses a directory view of search results. Due to
 limitations in the current KIO slave interface, it is currently not
 obviously useful.
 The interface is described in more detail inside a help file which you can
 access by entering recoll:/ inside the konqueror URL line (this works only
 if the recoll KIO slave has been previously installed).
